## STEP 2 (WAIT 3 DAYS)

**Subject:** Re: new english and math rollouts

Also {FIRST_NAME} {Kind of forgot to mention|Almost left this out|Just realized I didn't mention}, 1000s of k-12 {educators|teaching staff members|teachers} across {New Zealand|NZ|Aotearoa} are already using it to {generate|deploy|set up|create} complete curricular units that:

• match pedagogy and Ministry standards
• complete with slides, tests and activities that integrate with google slides or anything else.
• and even Māori specific lesson ideas like Mana Whenua and Ako

If you're open to trying it out, we can setup {COMPANY} on a free pilot for 30 days.

Do you think your teaching staff might be interested generating units in minutes instead of days?

We {do workshops all over Aotearoa all the time|regularly run workshops across Aotearoa|host workshops throughout Aotearoa|hold frequent workshops in Aotearoa}. {If you'd like to see a full demo I can share an invite|Happy to share an invite if you'd like the full demo|I can send over an invite if you want to see it in detail|If you want the full walkthrough, I can share an invite}.
