## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Spintax Best Practices:
1. **Keep variants semantically equivalent** - Don't change meaning drastically
2. **Maintain sentence flow** - All variants should read naturally
3. **Preserve key data points** - Stats like "2.3B visits" and "+45% YoY" stay consistent
4. **Vary phrasing, not facts** - "Reddit hit #2" vs "Reddit surpassed Facebook" (same fact, different words)
5. **Test readability** - Each spin should pass a natural reading test

### A/B Testing Strategy:
- **Week 1-2:** Test all 5 variants (A, B, C, D, E) with equal list splits
- **Week 3-4:** Double down on top 2 performers, kill bottom 2
- **Week 5+:** Optimize winning variant with new Spintax permutations

### Personalization Tokens:
- `{FIRST_NAME}` - Required
- `{COMPANY}` - Required
- `{YOUR_CATEGORY}` - Replace with actual category (e.g., "marketing automation")
- `{COLLEAGUE_1}` - Optional, use if you have hierarchical data
- `{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}` - Required

### Expected Performance:
Based on Launch Club's historical data:
- **V1 (Reddit Engagers):** 8.6% reply rate, 3.0% interested rate
- **V2 Projection:** 7-10% reply rate, 2.5-4% interested rate
- **Reasoning:** More specific value prop (LLM ranking) may reduce volume but increase quality

### Next Steps:
1. Import into EmailBison as sequence templates
2. Set wait times (Day 1 → Wait 2-3 days → Day 2 → Wait 1 day → Day 3)
3. Create 5 separate campaigns (one per variant) for testing
4. Monitor reply rate, interested rate, and sentiment
5. Optimize after 500 sends per variant
