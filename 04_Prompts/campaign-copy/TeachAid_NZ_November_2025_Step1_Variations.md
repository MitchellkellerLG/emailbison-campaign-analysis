# TeachAid NZ November 2025 - Step 1 Variations
**Based on:** 19.5% reply rate winning campaign + Nov 2025 curriculum research
**Tone:** Will Alred style (direct, conversational, problem-aware)
**Context:** 650+ principals signed open letter Oct 2025, Term 1 2026 mandatory implementation in 9 weeks

---

## VARIANT A - "October curriculum chaos"

**Subject:** October curriculum changes

Hi {FIRST_NAME}, weird one - did your staff already adapt unit plans in early 2025 for the new curriculum, only to find out the October release changed that same content again?

Cause I'm hearing from principals across Aotearoa that teachers are now rebuilding units for Term 1, 2026 (9 weeks away) - literacy with structured approaches, maths for Years 0-10, Māori-specific teachings like Mana Whenua and Ako.

If your team's in that boat, I can show you how schools are generating curriculum-aligned units in minutes instead of weekends using TeachAid.

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. We built this with Ministry of Education facilitators and Māori education experts - 1000s of NZ educators are already using it for the October 2025 curriculum rollout.

## VARIANT B - "you're not alone (650+ principals)"

**Subject:** you're not alone

Hi {FIRST_NAME}, odd one - if you're feeling overwhelmed by the curriculum rollout, you're not alone.

650+ principals just signed an open letter saying it's "too much, too fast, without enough support." The October changes hit content teachers already adapted, and now everyone's scrambling to rebuild units for the Term 1, 2026 start.

We're helping schools handle exactly this - generating complete curricular units in minutes (literacy with structured approaches, maths Years 0-10, Māori teachings like Mana Whenua and Ako included).

Want to see how it works?

## VARIANT C - "9 weeks until mandatory rollout"

**Subject:** 9 weeks until Term 1, 2026

Hi {FIRST_NAME}, weird one - are your staff rebuilding unit plans right now for the October curriculum changes?

Cause Term 1, 2026 hits in 9 weeks (mandatory implementation), and from what I'm hearing, teachers are scrambling to adapt for:
- Updated literacy content (structured approaches)
- Updated maths (now Years 0-10, not just 0-8)
- Māori-specific teachings (Mana Whenua, Ako)

On top of everything else they're closing out for 2025.

Schools across NZ are using TeachAid to generate curriculum-aligned units in minutes - complete with slides, tests, activities ready to deploy.

Should I show you how it works?

## Testing Recommendations

### Primary Test: Subject Lines
- **Variant A:** "October curriculum changes" (specific, event-based)
- **Variant B:** "you're not alone" (empathy, validation)
- **Variant C:** "9 weeks until Term 1, 2026" (deadline urgency)

**Hypothesis:** Variant C (deadline urgency) will outperform because it creates immediate time pressure.

### Secondary Test: Opening Hook
- **Variant A:** Problem acknowledgment ("did your staff already adapt...")
- **Variant B:** Empathy + social proof ("you're not alone, 650+ principals...")
- **Variant C:** Direct question + urgency ("are your staff rebuilding... 9 weeks away")

**Hypothesis:** Variant A (problem acknowledgment) will resonate most with principals who experienced double adaptation.

### Audience Segmentation
- **Small schools:** Use Variant B (empathy) - research shows only 69-84% have implementation plans
- **Rural schools:** Use Variant C (urgency) - less access to Ministry PLD, need self-service solution
- **Māori-medium:** Create separate variant emphasizing Māori education experts involvement

## Will Alred Voice Analysis

### Elements Used from Will's Style:

**1. Conversational Problem Recognition**
- "did your staff already adapt... only to find out..."
- "I'm hearing from principals across Aotearoa..."
- "from what I'm hearing, teachers are scrambling..."

**2. Empathetic Positioning**
- "you're not alone"
- "If your team's in that boat..."
- "if you're feeling overwhelmed..."

**3. Specific Details (Not Vague)**
- "650+ principals"
- "9 weeks away"
- "October release"
- "Years 0-10, not just 0-8"

**4. Cause-Effect Language**
- "Cause I'm hearing..."
- "Cause Term 1, 2026 hits..."

**5. Direct, Simple Asks**
- "Want to see how it works?"
- "Should I show you how it works?"
- "Interested in seeing this?"

**6. No Hype, Just Reality**
- Not: "Revolutionary AI tool transforms education!"
- Instead: "generating curriculum-aligned units in minutes"
- Not: "Game-changing solution!"
- Instead: "helping schools handle exactly this"

## Campaign Settings (Keep from Winning Campaign)

- **Plain Text:** Yes
- **Open Tracking:** Off
- **Max Emails Per Day:** 500
- **Max New Leads Per Day:** 500
- **Wait Time to Step 2:** 3 days

---

## Next Steps After Step 1

Based on research findings, recommend updating Step 2-4 to also include:
- Reference to small schools struggling most (only 69-84% have plans)
- Assessment tools mention (principals complain tools aren't ready)
- Multi-year classroom adaptability (teachers report uncertainty about this)

**File:** Continue with existing Step 2-4 from winning campaign, but consider adding November context in future iterations.
