### VARIANT A: Direct ask
**Subject:** Re: new english and math rollouts

Hello {FIRST_NAME}, I know you're definitely very busy, so instead of adding more to your plate,

would it make sense for me to connect directly with someone on your team?

I'd be happy to provide a complimentary 30-day pilot so they can build out units right away, no strings attached, and keep everything they create.

Should I set that up for your staff, or point it to the right person on your team?

# 📊 KEY INSIGHTS & WINNING ELEMENTS

## What Made Campaign #199 Win (19.5% vs 15.4% vs 6.6% vs 3.7%)

### 1. **Audience Matters**
- **Principals >> Teachers** for reply rates
- Principals (19.5% & 15.4%) vs Teachers (6.6% & 3.7%)
- Principals have budget authority and decision-making power

### 2. **Pain Point Specificity**
- **WINNER:** "new math and English curriculum changes" (specific, timely)
- LOWER: Generic "Māori curricular unit" (less urgent)
- Tying to curriculum rollouts creates immediate need

### 3. **Sequence Length**
- **WINNER:** 4-step sequence
- LOWER: 2-3 step sequences
- More touchpoints = more opportunities to convert

### 4. **Wait Times**
- Campaign #199: Wait 3 days → Wait 6 days → Wait 1 day
- Longer waits between Steps 2-3 performed better

### 5. **Spintax Density**
- Campaign #199 had the MOST spintax variations
- Helps avoid spam filters over large volumes

### 6. **Workshop Invitation**
- Step 4 "Coffee, food and AI teaching tools" unique to winning campaign
- In-person community building = higher engagement

### 7. **Burnout Angle**
- Teacher burnout variant tested in #199
- Alternative framing for different principal personalities

### 8. **Subject Line Strategy**
- "curriculum rollouts for LATs" >> "Māori curricular unit"
- LAT-specific (decision makers) >> general teacher pitch

### 9. **Volume Advantage**
- Campaign #199: 1,048 leads (larger sample = better optimization)
- Smaller campaigns may not have had time to optimize

## Copy Elements Present in ALL Winners

✅ "weird one" / "odd one" / "crazy question" opener
✅ Māori-specific teachings (Mana Whenua, Ako, Parakau)
✅ Ministry of Education partnership credibility
✅ "in minutes" time savings
✅ 30-day free trial, no strings
✅ "keep everything they create" ownership
✅ Heavy spintax throughout
✅ Plain text, no open tracking

## Why Teachers Campaigns Underperformed

1. **Less decision-making authority** - Can't commit to school-wide tools
2. **Less urgency** - Not responsible for curriculum implementation
3. **Shorter sequences** - Only 2 steps vs 4
4. **Generic positioning** - "Māori unit" less compelling than "curriculum changes"
5. **No workshop invitation** - Less community/social proof angle

---

# 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE CAMPAIGNS

## DO THIS (From Winners):
1. **Target principals/decision makers** not individual teachers
2. **Lead with specific curriculum pain points** not generic benefits
3. **Use 4-step sequences** with strategic wait times (3 days, 6 days, 1 day)
4. **Include workshop/community element** in later steps
5. **Test burnout angle** as variant for different personalities
6. **Heavy spintax** to avoid spam filters at scale
7. **Colleague referral in Step 3** creates viral loop
8. **"weird one" opener** consistently outperforms formal approaches

## AVOID THIS (From Lower Performers):
1. Don't pitch individual teachers (low authority)
2. Don't use generic "would you like X" without specific pain point
3. Don't stop at 2-3 steps (missed conversion opportunities)
4. Don't skip the social proof/workshop invitation
5. Don't forget LAT-specific angle (they're curriculum decision makers)
