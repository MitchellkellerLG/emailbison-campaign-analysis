## VARIANT D - "3rd curriculum in 3 years"

### STEP 1
**Subject:** {3rd curriculum in 3 years|86 math objectives|term 1 2026 rollout}

Hi {FIRST_NAME}, weird one - with the {third|3rd} math curriculum rewrite in three years (and 86 objectives in Year 1 alone), {would you like|are you interested in|do you want} curriculum-aligned units for {SCHOOL_NAME} that your {LATs and teachers|temporary and permanent staff|entire teaching team} can {deploy|use|implement} in minutes instead of building from scratch?

Complete with Māori-specific teachings like Mana Whenua and Ako, aligned with the new {math and English changes|curriculum updates|Ministry standards}.

If so, I can {walk you through|show you|guide you through|demonstrate} {generating it|putting it together|creating it} using TeachAid.

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. We {worked with|collaborated with|partnered with|co-designed alongside} the facilitators at the Ministry of Education and Māori education experts to {build a tool that does this in minutes|create a tool that handles this in minutes|develop a tool that makes this possible in minutes}.

### STEP 2 (WAIT 3 DAYS)
**Subject:** Re: {3rd curriculum in 3 years|86 math objectives|term 1 2026 rollout}

Also {FIRST_NAME}, {kind of forgot to mention|almost left this out|just realized I didn't mention} - with Term 1 2026 {coming up fast|right around the corner|approaching quickly}, 1000s of k-12 {educators|teaching staff members|teachers} across {New Zealand|NZ|Aotearoa} are already using TeachAid to {handle|manage|tackle} the new math and English rollout without {burning out|working weekends|losing their minds}.

They're {generating|creating|building|deploying} complete curricular units that:

• match pedagogy and Ministry standards for the new math (all 86 Year 1 objectives) and English curricula
• complete with slides, tests and activities that integrate with google slides or anything else
• and Māori specific lesson ideas like Mana Whenua and Ako built right in

If you're open to trying it out, we can setup {SCHOOL_NAME|COMPANY} on a free pilot for 30 days so your staff can {build units for Term 1|prep for the rollout|get ahead of implementation} before the summer break.

Do you think your teaching staff might be interested {generating|creating|building} units in minutes instead of days?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. We {do workshops all over Aotearoa all the time|regularly run workshops across Aotearoa|host workshops throughout Aotearoa|hold frequent workshops in Aotearoa}. {If you'd like to see a full demo I can share an invite|Happy to share an invite if you'd like the full demo|I can send over an invite if you want to see it in detail|If you want the full walkthrough, I can share an invite}.

**Subject:** Re: {3rd curriculum in 3 years|86 math objectives|term 1 2026 rollout}

{Hi|Hello} {FIRST_NAME}, was {giving this a little more thought|thinking about this a bit more} and wanted to ask

Would {COLLEAGUE_1} be {interested in trying this|open to trying this}? I {figured|thought} they {might be|could be} working on {math and English prep|Term 1 curriculum prep|new curriculum implementation} at the moment.

Happy to provide a full month on the house to build whatever units they need for the {new math objectives|new rollout|Term 1 implementation}. No strings. They {keep everything they create|get to keep everything they create}.

or is there someone better on the team to discuss this with?

## WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM CAMPAIGN #199 (THE WINNER)

### New Elements in Variant D:
1. **Subject lines reference crisis** - "3rd curriculum in 3 years" / "86 math objectives" / "Term 1 2026 rollout"
2. **Step 1 opening** - Acknowledges "third math curriculum rewrite in three years (and 86 objectives in Year 1 alone)"
3. **Step 2 urgency** - "with Term 1 2026 coming up fast" / "before the summer break"
4. **Step 2 specificity** - "all 86 Year 1 objectives" explicitly mentioned
5. **Step 3 context** - "math and English prep" / "Term 1 curriculum prep" vs generic "new curriculum prep"
6. **Step 4 positioning** - "helping hundreds of schools across Aotearoa navigate the third math curriculum in three years"
7. **Throughout** - "Term 1 2026" deadline creates implementation urgency

### Maintained from Campaign #199:
1. ✅ "weird one" opener (proven winner)
2. ✅ Māori-specific teachings (Mana Whenua, Ako)
3. ✅ Ministry of Education partnership mention
4. ✅ "minutes" time-saving benefit
5. ✅ 30-day free trial offer
6. ✅ Social proof ("1000s of educators across Aotearoa")
7. ✅ Workshop invitation with food/wine
8. ✅ Colleague referral (Step 3 viral loop)
9. ✅ Extensive spintax variation
10. ✅ Joke opener in Step 4

## HYPOTHESIS

**Expected Performance:**
This variant should **outperform** Campaign #199 (19.5% baseline) IF:
- Principals are feeling acute pain from the October 2025 rollout
- "3rd curriculum in 3 years" fatigue resonates strongly
- Term 1 2026 deadline creates urgency to act NOW

**Expected Performance:**
This variant may **underperform** Campaign #199 IF:
- Principals are overwhelmed and shutting down (don't want to think about it)
- Crisis language feels too negative vs neutral positioning
- Urgency creates pressure instead of motivation

**Recommended Testing:**
- Run 50/50 split test against Campaign #199
- Monitor reply sentiment (positive interest vs negative venting)
- If Variant D wins, consider creating even more crisis-focused variants
- If Variant D loses, soften crisis language but maintain specificity

---

## ALTERNATIVE SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS

If primary subject lines feel too crisis-heavy, test these alternatives:

**Softer Crisis:**
- {new math rollout support|curriculum implementation help|term 1 prep tool}
- {86 objectives covered|curriculum unit builder|ministry-aligned materials}
- {math and english prep|new curriculum units|term 1 resources}

**Benefit-Forward:**
- {units in minutes not days|instant curriculum units|ready-made ministry units}
- {māori-aligned curriculum|ministry-approved units|complete curriculum units}
- {curriculum sorted|teaching units ready|term 1 prepped}

**Curiosity-Based:**
- {curriculum question|teaching units|term 1 approach}
- {principal resources|curriculum solution|implementation support}
- {new approach|different method|faster way}

---

## TARGETING RECOMMENDATIONS

**Best Targets for Variant D:**
1. Principals who attended October 2025 Ministry briefings
2. Schools in regions with high math achievement pressure
3. Principals who signed or supported the "pause the rollout" petition
4. Schools with large Māori student populations (Te Tiriti controversy angle)
5. Primary schools (Years 1-6 hit hardest by 86 objectives)

**Avoid:**
- Brand new principals (may not understand context)
- Principals who champion frequent curriculum change
- Schools with dedicated curriculum coordinators (less pain)

---

## KEY METRICS TO WATCH

Compare Variant D vs Campaign #199 on:
1. **Reply Rate** (target: >19.5%)
2. **Interested Rate** (target: >3.9% based on 41/1048 from #199)
3. **Reply Sentiment** (positive interest vs negative venting)
4. **Meeting Booking Rate**
5. **Time to First Reply** (faster = higher urgency)
6. **Step Performance** (which step drives most replies)

---

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

- Use same targeting as Campaign #199 (New Zealand principals)
- Launch in **November 2025** for maximum Term 1 2026 urgency
- Consider geo-segmenting: Auckland/Wellington/Christchurch vs rural
- Monitor reply sentiment daily in first week
- Be prepared to pause if replies are overwhelmingly negative (damaged brand)
- Have support resources ready (workshops, demos, onboarding capacity)
