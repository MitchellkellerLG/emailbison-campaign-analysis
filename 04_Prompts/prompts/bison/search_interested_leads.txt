SEARCH PLAN FOR INTERESTED LEADS IN CLEANLAB CAMPAIGNS
=======================================================

Target Campaigns:
- Campaign 241: CleanLab Lending and Credit (NA/UK) - 1 interested lead
- Campaign 193: Cleanlab Agentic / production AI news 19th August - 2 interested leads  
- Campaign 188: Canada_ai_agents_customer_service_chatbots_last_3_6 months August 13th - 4 interested leads
- Campaign 165: EverGreen Armand Ruiz Engagement July 31 - 5 interested leads

Total Expected: 12 interested leads

Search Strategy:
1. The EmailBison API includes lead_campaign_data in the lead response
2. Each lead has a lead_campaign_data array showing their status in each campaign
3. We need to look for leads where:
   - campaign_id matches one of our target campaigns (241, 193, 188, 165)
   - interested field is true

Next Steps:
1. Paginate through all leads using the list_leads endpoint
2. For each lead, check their lead_campaign_data
3. If they are marked as interested in any of our target campaigns, record their details
4. Focus on extracting the job title (from 'title' or 'notes' field)
