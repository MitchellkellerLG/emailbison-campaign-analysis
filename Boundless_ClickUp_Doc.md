## ✅ Tuesday Decision Framework (Nov 19)

### Morning: Deliverability Check

**Pull ESP-specific metrics:**

| ESP Type | Bounce Rate Target | Reply Rate Target | Status |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Custom Domains** | <0.3% | >2.5% | TBD |
| **Google/Gmail** | <0.5% | >2.5% | TBD |
| **Outlook/Microsoft** | <1% | >2.5% | TBD |

**Deliverability Thresholds:**
- ✅ **Good** (<0.5% bounce) → Approve 30% volume increase
- ⚠️ **Acceptable** (0.5-2% bounce) → Approve 15% increase
- 🚨 **Issues** (>2% bounce) → Hold volume, investigate

---

### Afternoon: Winner Analysis

**Identify clear winners (30%+ performance advantage):**

**IF Winners Found:**
- Apply winning copy across all campaigns
- Launch Cycle II with winner variations
- Increase volume by 30%

**IF No Clear Winners:**
- Launch Cycle II with new copy pivots
- Continue testing original variants
- Increase volume by 30%

**Winner Criteria:**
- 30%+ higher reply rate than next best variant
- Minimum 3 replies
- Low bounce rate (<0.5%)
- Consistent across ESP types

---

## 📈 30% Volume Increase Plan

**IF deliverability ✅ Good:**

| Campaign | Current | +30% | New Daily Target |
|----------|---------|------|------------------|
| Campaign 379 | 204/day | +61 | **265/day** |
| Campaign 378 | 58/day | +17 | **75/day** |
| Campaign 375 | 35/day | +11 | **46/day** |
| **TOTAL** | 297/day | +89 | **386/day** |

**Settings Update:**
- Max new leads per day: 300 → **390** (all campaigns)
- Max emails per day: Keep at 400

---

## 🚀 Cycle II Launch Strategy

### Scenario A: Winners Identified (30%+ advantage)

**Apply winning elements across all campaigns:**
1. Identify winning subject lines, hooks, CTAs
2. Adapt winners to each audience
3. Test 3-4 minor variations per campaign
4. Target: 200-300 sends per variant total (Cycle I + II)

**Example:**
- Winner: "double down" (ROAS angle) from Campaign 379
- Apply ROAS messaging to Campaigns 378 & 375
- Create hybrid variants combining multiple winners

---

### Scenario B: No Clear Winners

**Launch new copy pivots:**

**Pivot 1: Pain Amplification**
```
Subject: Q4 stockout incoming?

{FIRST_NAME} - Are you going to run out of {PRODUCT_CATEGORY}
before Black Friday because you're $200K short on your PO?

73 stores did this last Q4. Don't be #74.

$50k-$1m funded in 72 hours. Pay back from sales only.

Worth avoiding the disaster?
```

**Pivot 2: Named Case Study**
```
Subject: How DYLN did $1.2M extra in Q4

{FIRST_NAME} - DYLN took $400K from us in August.

They're on track for $1.2M in additional revenue this Q4
from inventory they wouldn't have had otherwise.

Same playbook available for {COMPANY}?
```

**Pivot 3: Risk Reversal**
```
Subject: Zero risk capital

{FIRST_NAME} - $50k-$1m with:

$0 upfront
$0 monthly payments
$0 personal guarantee
$0 equity given up

You only pay when you make sales.

Risk-free call to explain?
```

**Pivot 4: Competitor Comparison**
```
Subject: Better than Shopify Capital

{FIRST_NAME} - Quick comparison:

Shopify Capital: 2-4 weeks, $50K max, fixed terms
Us: 72 hours, $10M max, flexible terms

Traditional loan: Personal guarantee, credit hit
Us: No guarantee, no credit check

Which makes sense for {COMPANY}?
```
