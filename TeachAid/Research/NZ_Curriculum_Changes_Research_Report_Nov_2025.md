## Executive Summary

New Zealand is in the midst of significant curriculum changes creating both urgency and controversy. The updated Years 0-10 curriculum for English, Te Reo Rangatira, Mathematics and Statistics, and Pāngarau was released October 19, 2025, with mandatory implementation starting Term 1, 2026.

**Key finding:** Over 650 principals signed an open letter urging the Education Minister to pause the rollout, citing it as "too much, too fast, without enough support."

## Critical Insights

1. **October 2025 Release Changed Already-Implemented Content** - Teachers who adapted in early 2025 must adapt AGAIN for 2026
2. **Term 1, 2026 Deadline** - 9 weeks away (as of Nov 2025)
3. **Principal Frustrations:** Assessment tools not ready, only 3 days PLD, one-size-fits-all approach
4. **Small Schools Struggling:** Only 69-84% have implementation plans
5. **Maths Harder Than English:** Teachers less confident with complex content

## Opportunity for TeachAid

Position as solution to system failures principals are publicly complaining about:
- Generate curriculum-aligned units in minutes (vs weekends)
- Complete with assessment components (tools principals say aren't ready)
- Adaptable for multi-year classrooms (one-size-fits-all problem)
- Self-service for small/rural schools (less access to Ministry PLD)
