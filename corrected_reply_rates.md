# Corrected Reply Rate Calculations

## Methodology Fix
**WRONG:** Reply Rate = unique_replies / emails_sent
**CORRECT:** Reply Rate = unique_replies / total_leads_contacted

emails_sent includes multiple follow-up emails to the same person
total_leads_contacted is the actual number of unique people reached
