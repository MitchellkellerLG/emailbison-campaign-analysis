## ⚠️ CRITICAL METHODOLOGY NOTE

**Metric Definitions:**
- **Reply Rate** = unique_replies / total_leads_contacted (% of contacts who replied)
- **Interested Rate** = interested / unique_replies (% of replies that became interested - **REPLY QUALITY METRIC**)
- **Contact-to-Interested** = interested / total_leads_contacted (overall campaign effectiveness)

**Important:** "Interested Rate" measures **reply quality**, NOT overall reach. This shows which campaigns generate genuinely qualified replies versus just curious responses.
