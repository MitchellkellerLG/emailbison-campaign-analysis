## CAMPAIGN NOTES

### Key Differences Between Variants
- **Variant A**: Focuses on Mamàhtawisiwin policy compliance and Truth and Reconciliation
- **Variant B**: Emphasizes French teacher shortage and bilingual capability

### Manitoba-Specific Elements Used
- **Mamàhtawisiwin: The Wonder We Are Born With** (official Indigenous education policy)
- "Walking Together" framing (Manitoba's reconciliation language)
- French teacher shortage and recruitment
- French immersion demand
- St. Boniface reference (francophone community)
- School divisions (not "boards")
- Winnipeg geographic reference

### Avoided
- Māori-specific references (replaced with FNMI)
- New Zealand geography
- "Aotearoa"

### Testing Hypothesis
**Variant A** may perform better with principals prioritizing Truth and Reconciliation and Indigenous education.
**Variant B** may perform better with principals struggling with French teacher recruitment and retention.
