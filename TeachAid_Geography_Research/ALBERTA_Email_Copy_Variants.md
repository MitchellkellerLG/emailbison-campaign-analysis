## CAMPAIGN NOTES

### Key Differences Between Variants
- **Variant A**: Focuses on new curriculum rollout (social studies K-6, Sept 2025/2026 implementation)
- **Variant B**: Emphasizes teacher workload crisis and strike action context

### Alberta-Specific Elements Used
- First Nations, Métis, and Inuit (all three groups, not just "Indigenous")
- Treaty education (prairie-specific)
- TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission) themes
- Alberta's new K-6 Learning Standards
- Alberta Teachers' Association reference
- "Lowest per-student funding in Canada"
- Calgary and Edmonton geographic references
- School divisions (not "boards")

### Maintained from NZ Template
- Short, punchy subject lines
- "weird one" opening (no spin syntax on this)
- Casual "Also {FIRST_NAME}" for Step 2
- Simple closing question pattern
- P.S. credibility formula: [Authority] + [experts] + [does this in minutes]
- Same subject line for Steps 2 and 3 (threading)
- Ultra-concise Step 3

### Testing Hypothesis
**Variant A** performs better with principals focused on curriculum compliance and upcoming September implementation.
**Variant B** performs better with principals concerned about teacher retention and workload issues.
