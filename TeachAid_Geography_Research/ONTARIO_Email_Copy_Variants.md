## CAMPAIGN NOTES

### Key Differences Between Variants
- **Variant A**: Focuses on declining math scores + foundational skills emphasis (Ontario's "back to basics")
- **Variant B**: Emphasizes EQAO testing accountability + time-saving for teachers

### Ontario-Specific Elements Used
- EQAO (Ontario standardized testing) with specific grades (3, 6, 9, 10)
- Declining math scores (provincial priority)
- Foundational skills focus (Math and Literacy curricula)
- "Back-to-basics" language for literacy and numeracy
- French immersion (holistic offering in Step 3)
- ESL/multilingual classrooms (holistic offering in Step 3)
- School boards (not divisions)
- Toronto, Ottawa references
- GTA (Greater Toronto Area)

### Maintained from NZ Template
- Short subject lines (focused on pain point)
- "weird one" opening
- "Also {FIRST_NAME}" for Step 2
- Simple question pattern
- P.S. credibility formula
- Same subject for Steps 2 and 3
- Concise Step 3 with colleague referral
- Free 30-day pilot offer

### Principal's Perspective
Both variants speak directly to what principals care about:
1. **Student outcomes** - EQAO scores, foundational skills mastery
2. **Teacher efficiency** - "minutes instead of days"
3. **Accountability** - Meeting Ministry expectations with less stress
4. **Comprehensive solution** - Works for all classroom types (French, ESL, mainstream)
