## 1. CURRICULUM OVERHAULS
**Impact Score: 7/10**

### Unique Quebec Education Structure

- Emphasis on digital competency
- **Quebec Education Program** for elementary schools

### School Service Centres
- New governance model replacing elected school boards
- Focus on direct service to schools vs. administration
- Creating transition challenges for teachers
- New reporting and accountability structures

**Marketing Hook:** Quebec teachers are navigating new school service centre structures while keeping up with curriculum changes - they need efficient tools to maintain quality during organizational transition.

## 2. INDIGENOUS/CULTURAL REQUIREMENTS
**Impact Score: 8/10**

### Truth and Reconciliation in Quebec
Quebec has unique Indigenous education considerations:

- **First Nations** communities across province
- **Inuit** communities in Nunavik (northern Quebec)
- No Métis recognition (unlike other provinces)
- TRC Calls to Action implementation
- Indigenous content integration requirements

### Quebec-Specific Cultural Context
- **11 First Nations** in Quebec:
  - Abenaki, Algonquin, Atikamekw, Cree, Huron-Wendat, Innu, Maliseet, Mi'gmaq, Mohawk, Naskapi
- **Inuit communities** in northern regions
- Complex relationship between Quebec nationalism and Indigenous rights

### Curriculum Integration
- Indigenous perspectives required in social studies/history
- **Quebec history** curriculum includes Indigenous peoples
- Growing emphasis on pre-contact Indigenous societies
- Teaching about residential schools and reconciliation

### Unique Challenges
- Indigenous education materials must be available **in French**
- Balancing Quebec cultural identity with Indigenous perspectives
- Limited French-language Indigenous education resources
- Need for culturally appropriate translation (not just literal)

**Marketing Hook:** Quebec teachers need Indigenous education resources specifically designed for francophone contexts - materials that authentically represent First Nations and Inuit perspectives while being pedagogically sound in French.

## 3. TEACHER SHORTAGE/CRISIS
**Impact Score: 10/10** ⭐ **CRITICAL ISSUE**

### Severe Teacher Shortage
Quebec faces one of the **most severe teacher shortages** in Canada:

- **Thousands of unfilled teaching positions**
- Heavy reliance on **uncertified/unqualified teachers**
- "Teacher permits" issued to non-qualified individuals
- High turnover rates
- Chronic vacancies in:
  - Montreal and surrounding areas
  - Rural regions
  - Specialized subjects
  - French as second language

### Unqualified Teachers
**MAJOR ISSUE**: Quebec extensively uses:
- **"Enseignants non légalement qualifiés"** (non-legally qualified teachers)
- People with bachelor's degrees but no teaching certification
- Emergency permits for subject specialists
- Long-term supply teachers in permanent positions

### Teacher Burnout
- Extremely high workload
- Large class sizes
- **Administrative burden** from school service centre transition
- Insufficient prep time
- Low salaries compared to other provinces
- Difficult working conditions in urban schools

### Retention Crisis
- 50% of teachers leave within first 2 years (Canada-wide)
- Quebec likely higher due to:
  - Salary levels
  - Working conditions
  - Administrative demands
  - Lack of support for new teachers

**Marketing Hook:** With thousands of uncertified teachers filling Quebec classrooms and qualified teachers overwhelmed by workload, tools that help ANY teacher (certified or not) create quality, curriculum-aligned materials are ESSENTIAL.

## 4. MULTILINGUAL CONSIDERATIONS
**Impact Score: 10/10** ⭐ **DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC**

### French-Language Mandate
Quebec has **strict language laws** affecting education:

- **Charter of the French Language (Bill 101)** - French is language of instruction
- **Bill 96** (2022) - strengthened French language requirements
- Students MUST attend French schools with very limited exceptions:
  - One parent educated in English in Canada
  - Temporary residents
  - Special humanitarian cases

### "English is taught as a second language in French primary schools from grade 1 onward"

### Language Requirements for TeachAid
**CRITICAL BUSINESS REQUIREMENT:**
- ALL curriculum materials MUST be in French
- Not just translations - **pedagogically designed for francophone learners**
- Subject-specific French terminology
- Quebec French (not France French or English translated)
- Alignment with **Quebec Education Program** in French

### Anglophone School Boards
- Small anglophone system exists (for eligible students)
- English-language school boards
- Still must teach French as second language
- Different market from francophone majority

### Indigenous Languages
- Increasing emphasis on Indigenous language education
- Materials needed in:
  - **Cree** (significant population in north)
  - **Inuktitut** (Nunavik region)
  - Other First Nations languages
- French-to-Indigenous language education resources scarce

### Immigrant Language Diversity
- Montreal has **extremely diverse** linguistic landscape
- **Francization** programs for immigrants
- Students arriving with 100+ different first languages
- Mandate to educate in French regardless of home language
- ESL/FSL (French as Second Language) critical need

**Marketing Hook:** Quebec teachers need curriculum materials NATIVELY DESIGNED in French (not translated) that help them teach students from diverse linguistic backgrounds while meeting strict French-language education mandates.

- Public schools face pressure to compete
- Teacher recruitment challenges (private schools more attractive)

### Performance Pressures
- Competition with well-funded private schools
- Standardized testing and accountability
- **PISA and international comparisons**
- Provincial examinations
- Public perception challenges

### Equity Concerns
- Performance gaps between:
  - Public and private students

  - Francophone and anglophone systems
  - Schools in wealthy vs. low-income areas
- Indigenous student achievement gaps

### School Service Centre Transition
- Organizational changes affecting performance
