## KEY INSIGHTS BY GEOGRAPHY

### ALBERTA
- **Timing Urgency**: Sept 2025 (K-3) and Sept 2026 (Gr 4-6) social studies rollout = IMMEDIATE need
- **Unique Hook**: "Alberta spends the least on public education per-student in Canada"
- **Cultural Element**: First Nations, Métis, AND Inuit (all three groups)
- **Current Crisis**: Teacher strike effective October 2024

### MANITOBA
- **Policy**: Mamàhtawisiwin ("The Wonder We Are Born With") = strongest Indigenous ed policy in Canada
- **Language**: French teacher recruitment crisis + Indigenous languages
- **Framing**: "Walking Together" reconciliation language
- **Market**: Smaller but easier to penetrate

### QUEBEC
- **CRITICAL**: MUST be in Quebec French (NOT translated from English)
- **Unique Challenge**: Thousands of "enseignants non légalement qualifiés" (non-certified teachers)
- **Competition**: 17% private school attendance = quality pressure on public schools
- **Language**: French-first everything, Bill 96 requirements

### ONTARIO
- **Market Size**: LARGEST in Canada (2M+ students, 120K+ teachers)
- **Diversity**: 200+ languages in Toronto, 20%+ EAL students
- **Testing**: EQAO high-stakes at multiple grade levels
- **Districts**: TDSB, Peel, York Region = massive opportunities

### BRITISH COLUMBIA
- **Foundation**: First Peoples Principles of Learning = CORE of curriculum (not add-on)
- **Diversity**: 250+ languages in Metro Vancouver
- **Pedagogy**: Competency-based, inquiry-focused, Big Ideas
- **Culture**: Progressive, values-driven, Indigenous reconciliation priority

### OHIO
- **Fear Factor**: A-F Report Cards, history of state takeovers
- **Crisis**: Emergency permits widely used, thousands of unfilled positions
- **Accountability**: Ohio State Tests determine school ratings
- **ESCs**: Educational Service Centers = bulk adoption opportunity

### SOUTH AFRICA
- **Most Complex**: 11 official languages = unprecedented challenge
- **Teacher Crisis**: Severe capacity issues, under-qualified teachers common
- **Matric Pressure**: Public rankings, school survival depends on pass rates
- **Opportunity**: Virtually NO competition for true multilingual solutions

### UNITED KINGDOM
- **Workload**: 60-hour weeks, #1 reason teachers quit
- **Ofsted**: High-stakes inspections, ratings affect school survival
- **Retention**: 50% leave within 5 years
- **Terminology**: MUST use UK language (maths, Year groups, pupils, head teachers, etc.)

---

## ADAPTATION STRATEGY FROM NZ TEMPLATE

### What We Kept (Core Structure)
- 3-step email sequence (outreach → value expansion → referral)
- Spin syntax for A/B testing
- Wait times (3 days, 1 day)
- "Weird one" opening hook
- Free 30-day pilot offer
- Referral to COLLEAGUE_1
- P.S. credibility builder

### What We Changed (Geography-Specific)
- **Māori content** → Regional Indigenous/cultural content (FNMI in Canada, decolonization in SA, etc.)
- **Ministry of Education + Māori educators** → Local authorities and Indigenous partners
- **"Aotearoa" / "New Zealand"** → Geography name
- **LATs** → Local teacher capacity issue (emergency permits, non-certified, etc.)
- **Math and English curriculum changes** → Local curriculum pain points
- **"1000s across NZ"** → "1000s across [geography]"

### Split Test Strategy
Each geography has 2 variants testing different pain points:
- **Variant A**: Usually compliance/curriculum-focused
- **Variant B**: Usually teacher capacity/crisis-focused

This allows testing which motivator resonates stronger in each market.

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE LAUNCH (Next 30 Days)
**Geographies**: Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia
- **Why**: Active curriculum changes, large markets, timing urgency
- **Alberta**: Sept 2025 social studies rollout creates immediate urgency
- **Ontario**: Largest market, EQAO season approaching
- **BC**: Strong opportunity, progressive culture receptive to innovation

### PHASE 2: Q1 2026 LAUNCH
**Geographies**: UK, Ohio
- **Why**: Large English-language markets, severe crises, budget cycles
- **UK**: Budget planning for next school year (Sept 2026)
- **Ohio**: Spring budget cycles for following school year

### PHASE 3: COMPLEX MARKETS
**Geographies**: Quebec, South Africa
- **Why**: Require significant adaptation (language, multilingual tech)
- **Quebec**: REQUIRES Quebec French translation and separate product strategy
- **South Africa**: REQUIRES multilingual capability (11 languages)

### PHASE 4: SECONDARY MARKETS
**Geographies**: Manitoba
- **Why**: Smaller market, but strong fit - good for testing refined approach

---

## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### For Quebec
1. ✅ Professional Quebec French translation (NOT France French)
2. ✅ Quebec educator review of terminology
3. ✅ Cultural adaptation beyond literal translation
4. ✅ Separate francophone marketing materials

### For South Africa
1. ✅ Multilingual product capability (start with isiZulu, isiXhosa, English, Afrikaans)
2. ✅ Decolonized content development (African perspectives, not Western)
3. ✅ Tiered pricing by school quintile
4. ✅ Government tender preparation (Department of Basic Education)

### For UK
1. ✅ UK terminology audit (maths not math, Year not grade, etc.)
2. ✅ UK educator review for cultural fit
3. ✅ Evidence base documentation (UK values research)
4. ✅ Multi-Academy Trust partnerships

### For All Geographies
1. ✅ EmailBison campaign setup with proper segmentation
2. ✅ Lead lists for each geography (principals/head teachers)
3. ✅ Sender email accounts configured for each region
4. ✅ A/B testing framework to track Variant A vs. Variant B performance
5. ✅ CRM integration for follow-up sequences

---

## TEACHER VARIANTS STILL NEEDED

**NOTE**: Current deliverables are for PRINCIPALS/HEAD TEACHERS only.

**Still Required**: Teacher-targeted variants for each geography

### Differences for Teacher Copy
- Direct benefit messaging (help YOU save time)
- Less administrative language
- More classroom/practical focus
- Peer testimonials rather than school-wide stats
- Different subject lines
- Potentially different pain points

**Recommendation**: Create teacher variants AFTER validating principal variants in Phase 1 markets.

## EMAILBISON CAMPAIGN UPLOAD

### Current State
The user mentioned wanting to upload these as split tests against current campaigns in those geographies on EmailBison.

### Campaigns Identified in EmailBison
From earlier query, we found:
- Ohio campaigns (Educational Service Centers - Teachers, Principals, Superintendents)
- New Zealand campaigns (Teachers, Principals)
- US campaigns (BOCES, New York schools)

### Upload Recommendation
For each geography with existing campaigns:
1. Create NEW campaigns with localized copy
2. Run as A/B test against current generic copy
3. Monitor performance metrics:
   - Open rates
   - Reply rates
   - Interested conversions
   - Meeting bookings

**Note**: Would need EmailBison API access or manual campaign creation to upload these sequences.
