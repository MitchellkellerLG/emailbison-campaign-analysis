- Last Updated: Nov 25, 2025 (19:07:58 UTC)

**Analysis**:
⚠️ **UNDERPERFORMING** - Only 1.3% reply rate (lowest except stalled campaigns)
❌ Despite being largest campaign (5,903 emails), only 29 replies
📊 Running for 3 months with consistent low engagement
🔍 Stark contrast with Alberta Teachers (10.3%) - same role, same country, very different results

**Critical Questions**:
1. Why is BC so different from Alberta? (1.3% vs 10.3%)
2. Different messaging? Different list quality? Different timing?
3. This campaign has sent 3x more emails than Alberta but gotten 1/3 the replies

**Recommendation**:
⚠️ **Consider pausing** to analyze why BC underperforms Alberta so dramatically. Don't continue investing in a 1.3% reply rate when you know 10.3% is achievable with teachers in Canada.

- **Campaign 355** (NZ Teachers): 2,328 leads, only 2.4% contacted
- **Campaign 249** (Ontario Teachers): 2,336 leads, only 2.8% contacted

**Impact**: 4,664 leads frozen

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Check sender email account health/authentication
- [ ] Verify campaign schedule settings
- [ ] Check for error logs in send history
- [ ] Test manual email send from affected accounts
- [ ] Review rate limiting/throttling settings

- [ ] Document what makes it different from BC campaign
- [ ] Create new campaigns using Alberta template for:

  - New Brunswick teachers (est. 200-400 leads)
- [ ] Launch 1-2 provinces this week

## 💡 FINAL THOUGHTS

### The Good News 👍
You have **proven formulas that work**:
- Alberta campaign (10.3% reply rate) - reproducible
- South Africa campaigns (5-8% reply rates, 55.6% interested) - scalable
- Reply subsequences (40-75% reply rates) - automated
- CRM trial nurture (7.2% reply rate) - systematic

### The Challenge 👎
You have **5,000+ leads frozen** in stalled/underperforming campaigns that need urgent attention:
- 2,328 NZ leads waiting (stalled)
- 2,336 Ontario leads waiting (stalled)
- 2,275+ BC leads in underperforming campaign

### The Opportunity 🚀
If you:
1. Fix the 2 stalled campaigns (4,664 leads)
2. Clone Alberta success (10.3% template)
3. Scale South Africa (consistent 5-8% performer)
4. Pause/fix BC (stop the bleeding)

You could **3-5x your interested lead flow** within 30-60 days.

### The Action Required 🎯
This report identifies clear winners and clear losers. The strategic path forward is:
- **Double down** on what works (Alberta, SA, CRM trials, subsequences)
- **Fix urgently** what's broken (NZ, Ontario stalls)
- **Stop** what's failing (BC, Superintendents)
