---

## Executive Summary

We currently have **15 active campaigns** running across multiple geographies with comprehensive reach. This includes newly launched Manitoba teachers, ongoing CRM data outreach (5,500+ personal emails from signup data), and multiple geographic tests.

---

## 📊 Methodology Note: Corrected Metrics

**IMPORTANT:** We've corrected how we calculate **Interested Rate**:

- **Reply Rate** = unique_replies / total_leads_contacted (what % of contacts replied)
- **Interested Rate** = interested / unique_replies (what % of replies became interested - **REPLY QUALITY**)
- **Contact-to-Interested** = interested / total_leads_contacted (overall campaign effectiveness)

**Interested Rate now measures reply quality**, not overall reach. This shows us which campaigns generate genuinely qualified replies vs. just curious responses.

## 🎯 New Copy Strategy: Ego-Appeal Positioning

### The Problem
Campaigns like **Ontario Principals** (53 replies, 1 interested) and **SA Principals** (5 replies, 0 interested) show decision-makers are engaging but not qualifying.

### The Solution
**For higher-level positions (principals, administrators, directors):**

**Old Approach:**
❌ Direct pitch: "Would you like to see TeachAid?"
❌ Transactional: Asking for their time/attention

**New Approach:**
✅ **Expert feedback request:** "We'd love your expert feedback on..."
✅ **Ego-appeal positioning:** Position them as the authority
✅ **Consultative tone:** "We value your insights as an education leader"
✅ **Reason for the call:** Changed from sales to advisory consultation

**Why This Works:**
1. Appeals to professional ego and expertise
2. Lowers resistance by removing sales pressure
3. Positions TeachAid as seeking validation (not selling)
4. Creates reciprocity ("they helped us, now they're invested")

**Implementation Priority:**
1. **Ontario Principals (#248)** - 53 engaged principals waiting
2. **SA Principals (#342)** - 5 engaged, 0 qualified
3. **NY Principals (#273)** - 20 engaged, good baseline to test improvement
