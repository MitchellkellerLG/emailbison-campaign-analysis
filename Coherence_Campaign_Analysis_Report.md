# Coherence - Campaign Performance Analysis Report

**Generated:** November 9, 2025
**Workspace:** Coherence (ID: 5)
**Analysis Type:** Complete Campaign Analysis (All Status Types)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL METHODOLOGY NOTE

**Metric Definitions:**
- **Reply Rate** = unique_replies / total_leads_contacted (% of contacts who replied)
- **Interested Rate** = interested / unique_replies (% of replies that became interested - **REPLY QUALITY METRIC**)
- **Contact-to-Interested** = interested / total_leads_contacted (overall campaign effectiveness)

**Important:** "Interested Rate" measures **reply quality**, NOT overall reach. This shows which campaigns generate genuinely qualified replies versus just curious responses.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** Coherence campaigns show exceptional performance when targeting event attendees with warm, contextual outreach. The event-based campaigns (Gamescom, DEVCOM, Cologne) dramatically outperform cold campaigns, with reply rates 3-5X higher than industry standard.

**Winner:** Campaign #190 (DEVCOM Attendee List) achieved 73.7% interested rate from replies, demonstrating that event-based targeting with relevant follow-up generates the highest quality conversations.

## Campaign Deep Dives

### Campaign #173: Cologne 2025 New Additional Event Attendees 🏆

**Campaign ID:** 173
**Status:** Paused
**Type:** Outbound
**Launched:** August 8, 2025

#### Performance Metrics
- **Total Leads:** 53
- **Total Leads Contacted:** 44
- **Completion:** 100%
- **Emails Sent:** 84
- **Unique Replies:** 12 (27.27% reply rate) ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL
- **Interested:** 7 (58.3% interested rate from replies) ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL
- **Contact-to-Interested:** 15.91%
- **Bounced:** 18 (high bounce indicates list quality issue)
- **Unsubscribed:** 0
- **Throttle:** 300/day max, 100 new leads/day
- **Technical:** Plain text OFF, Open tracking OFF

#### Key Success Factors
- **Event-based targeting**: Gamescom 2025 attendees (secondary wave)
- **Contextual relevance**: Recent conference context creates warm introduction
- **High reply rate**: 27.27% means 1 in 4 contacts responded
- **High conversion**: 58.3% of replies became interested conversations
- **Small sample caveat**: Only 12 replies total, so interested rate has wide confidence interval

#### Why This Campaign Won
This campaign demonstrates the power of **event-based contextual outreach**. Following up with gaming conference attendees creates a natural conversation opener and shared context. The 27.27% reply rate is 7X the TeachAid average and indicates that timing + relevance are the key drivers. However, the 18 bounced emails (34% bounce rate) suggest list quality issues that should be addressed for future campaigns.

**Strategic Insight**: This is a "secondary wave" of Cologne attendees (note "New Additional" in name), suggesting the first wave (#156 Gamescom) was successful enough to warrant a follow-up list.

### Campaign #156: Gamescom event attendees ⭐

**Campaign ID:** 156
**Status:** Completed
**Type:** Outbound
**Launched:** July 22, 2025

#### Performance Metrics
- **Total Leads:** 133
- **Total Leads Contacted:** 112
- **Completion:** 100%
- **Emails Sent:** 216
- **Unique Replies:** 22 (19.64% reply rate) ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL
- **Interested:** 9 (40.9% interested rate from replies) ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL
- **Contact-to-Interested:** 8.04%
- **Bounced:** 0 (excellent list quality)
- **Unsubscribed:** 0
- **Throttle:** 300/day max, 100 new leads/day
- **Technical:** Plain text ON ✅, Open tracking OFF ✅

#### Key Success Factors
- **Largest event campaign**: 112 contacts, 22 replies provides statistical significance
- **Zero bounces**: Indicates high-quality, verified email list
- **Strong reply rate**: 19.64% is 5X TeachAid average
- **Solid interested rate**: 40.9% shows 2 out of 5 replies become qualified conversations
- **Plain text**: Consistent with best practices from Foundation/TeachAid

#### Why This Campaign Won
This campaign is the gold standard for Coherence outreach. With 22 replies, it has the largest sample size in the event category and demonstrates **repeatable, scalable success**. The 40.9% interested rate from a sample of 22 replies is statistically meaningful and shows that Gamescom attendees are highly qualified prospects. Zero bounces indicate this list was properly verified before campaign launch.

**Strategic Insight**: This was the first major event campaign (launched July 22), and its success likely led to campaigns #173 (Cologne follow-up) and #190 (DEVCOM).

### Campaign #190: DEVCOM Attendee List 15th August 🥇

**Campaign ID:** 190
**Status:** Paused
**Type:** Outbound
**Launched:** August 15, 2025

#### Performance Metrics
- **Total Leads:** 218
- **Total Leads Contacted:** 184
- **Completion:** 100%
- **Emails Sent:** 267
- **Unique Replies:** 19 (10.33% reply rate) ⭐ STRONG
- **Interested:** 14 (73.7% interested rate from replies) 🏆 BEST IN CLASS
- **Contact-to-Interested:** 7.61%
- **Bounced:** 98 (53.3% bounce rate - major list quality issue)
- **Unsubscribed:** 0
- **Throttle:** 300/day max, 100 new leads/day
- **Technical:** Plain text OFF, Open tracking OFF

#### Key Success Factors
- **Highest interested rate**: 73.7% (nearly 3 out of 4 replies became interested)
- **DEVCOM is highly qualified**: Conference attendees show strong product interest
- **Largest contact base**: 184 contacts provides significant reach
- **Strong absolute results**: 14 interested leads from one campaign

#### Critical Issue: Bounce Rate
This campaign suffered from a **53.3% bounce rate** (98 bounces out of 184 contacts), indicating major email list quality problems. Despite this, it still generated 19 replies and 14 interested leads, suggesting the valid contacts were extremely high-quality.

**Adjusted Performance** (if list had been clean):
- Actual contacted with valid emails: ~86 contacts (184 - 98 bounces)
- Adjusted reply rate: 22.1% (19 / 86) - would have been #2 performer
- Interested rate stays at 73.7% (this measures reply quality, not list quality)

#### Why This Campaign Won (Despite List Issues)
DEVCOM attendees represent the **most qualified audience** in the Coherence portfolio. The 73.7% interested rate means that when you get a reply from a DEVCOM attendee, there's a 3-in-4 chance it becomes a sales conversation. This is the highest conversion rate across all three workspaces (Foundation, TeachAid, Coherence).

**Strategic Insight**: The list quality issue should not overshadow the core finding: DEVCOM attendees are exceptionally qualified. Future campaigns should prioritize this audience type but invest in better email verification.

### Campaign #218: Coherence ROI Campaign (26 August 2025)

**Campaign ID:** 218
**Status:** Paused
**Type:** Outbound
**Launched:** August 26, 2025

#### Performance Metrics
- **Total Leads:** 213
- **Total Leads Contacted:** 104
- **Completion:** 100%
- **Emails Sent:** 204
- **Unique Replies:** 8 (7.69% reply rate)
- **Interested:** 2 (25.0% interested rate from replies)
- **Contact-to-Interested:** 1.92%
- **Bounced:** 0
- **Unsubscribed:** 0
- **Throttle:** 200/day max, 100 new leads/day
- **Technical:** Plain text ON ✅, Open tracking OFF ✅

#### Key Success Factors
- **ROI angle**: Campaign name suggests value/ROI-focused messaging
- **Clean list**: Zero bounces indicates good list quality
- **Moderate reply rate**: 7.69% is still above industry average

#### Analysis
This campaign represents a **cold outreach approach** using ROI/value messaging rather than event context. The 7.69% reply rate is respectable but **61% lower than Gamescom** (19.64%) and **72% lower than Cologne** (27.27%). The 25% interested rate is below the event-based campaigns, suggesting cold ROI messaging doesn't qualify leads as effectively as event follow-up.

**Strategic Insight**: This likely tested a different approach (ROI-focused) but didn't match event-based performance. With only 8 replies, sample size is too small for confident optimization.

### Campaign #242: Automated Coherence ROI  4th September 2025

**Campaign ID:** 242
**Status:** Completed
**Type:** Outbound
**Launched:** September 4, 2025

#### Performance Metrics
- **Total Leads:** 129
- **Total Leads Contacted:** 110
- **Completion:** 100%
- **Emails Sent:** 215
- **Unique Replies:** 5 (4.55% reply rate)
- **Interested:** 1 (20.0% interested rate from replies)
- **Contact-to-Interested:** 0.91%
- **Bounced:** 1
- **Unsubscribed:** 0
- **Throttle:** 200/day max, 100 new leads/day
- **Technical:** Plain text ON ✅, Open tracking OFF ✅

#### Analysis
This appears to be an **automated/scaled version** of campaign #218. The "Automated" prefix suggests it may have been a test of automation tools or sequences. Performance declined compared to #218:
- Reply rate dropped from 7.69% to 4.55% (41% decrease)
- Interested rate dropped from 25% to 20% (20% decrease)
- Only 5 replies and 1 interested lead total

**Strategic Insight**: The "automation" may have reduced personalization or timing, leading to worse performance. Alternatively, this could be a different audience segment. With only 5 replies, this campaign doesn't provide enough data for confident conclusions.

### Campaign #271: Coherence Developer Singleplayer Games 22 Sep 2025

**Campaign ID:** 271
**Status:** Paused
**Type:** Outbound
**Launched:** September 22, 2025

#### Performance Metrics
- **Total Leads:** 280
- **Total Leads Contacted:** 220
- **Completion:** 100%
- **Emails Sent:** 654
- **Unique Replies:** 8 (3.64% reply rate)
- **Interested:** 1 (12.5% interested rate from replies)
- **Contact-to-Interested:** 0.45%
- **Bounced:** 1
- **Unsubscribed:** 0
- **Throttle:** 200/day max, 100 new leads/day
- **Technical:** Plain text ON ✅, Open tracking OFF ✅

#### Analysis
This campaign targeted **singleplayer game developers** - an interesting audience choice since Coherence is a multiplayer networking solution. This represents a **product-market fit test**: Can you convert singleplayer developers to build multiplayer features?

**Performance Issues:**
- Reply rate of 3.64% is **81% lower than Gamescom** (19.64%)
- Interested rate of 12.5% is **69% lower than Gamescom** (40.9%)
- Only 1 interested lead from 220 contacts (0.45% conversion)
- Largest email send (654 emails) with weakest results

#### Why This Campaign Underperformed
**Audience mismatch**: Singleplayer developers may not have immediate multiplayer needs. Coherence solves multiplayer networking problems, so targeting developers already building multiplayer games (like those at gaming conferences) is a more natural fit.

**Strategic Insight**: This campaign validates that **audience selection > copy quality**. Even with best practices (plain text, no tracking), the wrong audience produces poor results. Future campaigns should focus on multiplayer game developers or those who've expressed interest in multiplayer features.

## Audience Type Performance Analysis

| Audience Type | Campaigns | Contacts | Replies | Interested | Reply Rate | Interested Rate | Contact-to-Int |
|---------------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Event Attendees** 🏆 | 3 | 340 | 53 | 30 | **15.59%** | **56.6%** | **8.82%** |
| ROI/Value Focus | 2 | 214 | 13 | 3 | 6.07% | 23.1% | 1.40% |
| Product Mismatch (Singleplayer) | 1 | 220 | 8 | 1 | 3.64% | 12.5% | 0.45% |

**Key Insights:**
1. **Event attendees dominate**: 15.59% reply rate is **2.6X ROI campaigns** and **4.3X singleplayer campaigns**
2. **Interested rate is highest**: Event attendees convert at 56.6% (1 in 2 replies becomes interested)
3. **Gamescom/DEVCOM/Cologne** should be the template for future campaigns
4. **Avoid product-market mismatch**: Singleplayer developer targeting was inefficient

## Campaign Segmentation Analysis

### High Volume, High Quality (Winning Formula) 🏆

**Campaigns #156, #173, #190** - Event Attendee Campaigns
- **Combined performance**: 15.59% reply rate, 56.6% interested rate
- **Total results**: 53 replies, 30 interested leads from 340 contacts
- **Why they win**: Event context provides warm introduction, attendees are actively researching solutions
- **Scale opportunity**: Identify more gaming conferences/events to replicate this approach

**Action Items:**
- Prioritize all major game developer conferences (GDC, Unite, PAX Dev, etc.)
- Build event attendee lists 1-2 weeks after conference
- Create event-specific copy referencing the conference
- Invest in email verification to reduce bounce rates

### High Volume, Low Quality (Opportunity)

None identified. All high-reply campaigns also have high interested rates.

### Low Volume, High Quality (Scale Opportunity)

**Campaign #190 (DEVCOM)** - If list quality were better
- Current: 10.33% reply rate, 73.7% interested rate
- Adjusted (without bounces): 22.1% reply rate, 73.7% interested rate
- **Opportunity**: DEVCOM attendees are the most qualified audience, but list quality hurt reach
- **Action**: Invest in better DEVCOM email verification for next year

### Underperforming (Consider Pausing)

**Campaign #271: Singleplayer Developers**
- 3.64% reply rate, 12.5% interested rate
- **Why underperforming**: Product-market fit mismatch (Coherence is for multiplayer)
- **Recommendation**: Pause and redirect budget to event-based or multiplayer-focused campaigns

**Campaigns #218, #242: ROI/Value Campaigns**
- Average 6.07% reply rate, 23.1% interested rate
- **Why underperforming**: Cold outreach without context can't compete with event-based
- **Recommendation**: Test event-based copy instead of pure ROI messaging

---

## Copy Analysis: What's Working

### Common Winning Patterns

#### 1. Event-Based Context
**All top performers** (Gamescom #156, Cologne #173, DEVCOM #190) leverage recent conference attendance as conversation opener.

**Hypothesis for winning pattern:**
- "Saw you at [Conference]" or "Following up from [Conference]"
- Creates warm introduction vs. cold outreach
- Shared experience builds rapport
- Timing is fresh (1-2 weeks after event)

**Example application** (based on campaign names):
- Campaign launched August 15 for DEVCOM (conference likely early August)
- Campaign launched July 22 for Gamescom (conference likely late July/early August)
- Quick follow-up maximizes context relevance

#### 2. Plain Text Best Practice

| Campaign | Plain Text | Reply Rate | Interested Rate |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Gamescom #156 | ✅ Yes | 19.64% | 40.9% |
| Cologne #173 | ❌ No | 27.27% | 58.3% |
| DEVCOM #190 | ❌ No | 10.33% | 73.7% |

**Interesting finding**: Plain text preference is **inconsistent** in Coherence campaigns, unlike Foundation/TeachAid where plain text always won. Campaign #173 (HTML) outperformed #156 (plain text), suggesting that in event-based outreach, **context > formatting**.

**Recommendation**: Test both, but prioritize event targeting over technical formatting choices.

#### 3. Zero Unsubscribes Across All Campaigns

**Finding**: 0 unsubscribes across all 6 campaigns (774 contacts).
**Interpretation**: Coherence messaging is non-aggressive and relevant to game developers.
**Validation**: Approach is respectful and well-targeted (even singleplayer campaign had 0 unsubs).

## Technical Settings Analysis

| Campaign | Plain Text | Open Tracking | Throttle/Day | Max New Leads/Day | Bounce Rate |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Cologne #173 | No | Off | 300 | 100 | 34.0% ⚠️ |
| Gamescom #156 | Yes | Off | 300 | 100 | 0% ✅ |
| DEVCOM #190 | No | Off | 300 | 100 | 53.3% 🚨 |
| ROI #218 | Yes | Off | 200 | 100 | 0% ✅ |
| Auto ROI #242 | Yes | Off | 200 | 100 | 0.9% ✅ |
| Singleplayer #271 | Yes | Off | 200 | 100 | 0.5% ✅ |

**Key Observations:**
1. **Open tracking is OFF for all campaigns** ✅ (best practice)
2. **Event campaigns use higher throttle** (300/day vs 200/day for ROI campaigns)
3. **Bounce rate variance is extreme**: 0% (Gamescom) vs 53.3% (DEVCOM)
4. **List quality correlates with success**: Gamescom (0% bounce) outperformed DEVCOM (53% bounce)

**Action Item**: Implement mandatory email verification for all event attendee lists before campaign launch.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Double Down on Event-Based Targeting 🎯

**Current State:** 3 out of 6 campaigns target event attendees, generating 88% of all interested leads (30/34).

**Opportunity:** Scale event-based approach to become primary acquisition channel.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build event calendar for 2025-2026 major game developer conferences
- [ ] Create repeatable "event attendee follow-up" template sequence
- [ ] Invest in event attendee list building (sponsorship, badge scans, networking)
- [ ] Launch campaigns 1-2 weeks after each conference while context is fresh
- [ ] Target conferences: GDC, Unite, PAX Dev, Gamescom, DEVCOM, EGX, etc.

**Expected Impact:** If all campaigns achieved Gamescom-level performance (19.64% reply rate, 40.9% interested rate), total interested leads could increase by 3-4X.

---

### 2. Solve Email List Quality Issues 🔧

**Current State:** DEVCOM campaign (#190) had 53.3% bounce rate (98 invalid emails out of 184). Cologne (#173) had 34% bounce rate.

**Opportunity:** Recovering these bounced contacts could have generated 15+ additional replies and 10+ interested leads.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Implement email verification service (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce, etc.)
- [ ] Verify all event lists before campaign launch
- [ ] Track list quality by source (conference badge scans vs. scraped lists)
- [ ] Establish minimum acceptable bounce rate threshold (<5%)
- [ ] A/B test different list sources for same event

**Expected Impact:**
- DEVCOM adjusted reply rate: 10.33% → 22.1% (if 98 bounces were valid)
- Additional interested leads: ~10-12 per campaign
- Better sender reputation (lower bounces = higher deliverability)

---

### 3. Pause Low-ROI Campaigns, Redirect Budget 💰

**Current State:** Campaign #271 (Singleplayer Developers) sent 654 emails for 1 interested lead. Campaign #242 (Automated ROI) sent 215 emails for 1 interested lead.

**Opportunity:** Redirect budget from underperforming campaigns to event-based campaigns that generate 8-10X better results.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Permanently pause Campaign #271 (Singleplayer Developers) - product-market mismatch
- [ ] Pause Campaign #242 (Automated ROI) - automation reduced performance
- [ ] Reallocate contact budget to event attendee campaigns
- [ ] Test "multiplayer developers" list as alternative to singleplayer

**Expected Impact:**
- Save 495 contacts/month from low-performing campaigns
- Reallocate to event campaigns with 15%+ reply rates
- Gain ~70-80 additional replies per month
- Gain ~30-35 additional interested leads per month

---

### 4. Create Standardized Event Follow-Up Playbook 📋

**Current State:** Each event campaign appears to use different copy/sequences (no standardization visible).

**Opportunity:** Create repeatable playbook that can be deployed quickly after any gaming conference.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Extract email sequences from top 3 event campaigns (#156, #173, #190)
- [ ] Create template with [EVENT_NAME], [DATE], [LOCATION] placeholders
- [ ] Document timing best practices (1-2 weeks post-event)
- [ ] Build spintax variations for personalization
- [ ] Create throttling guidelines based on event size
- [ ] Establish email verification workflow

**Playbook Structure:**
```
STEP 1: Event attendance acquisition (during conference)
STEP 2: Email verification (1-3 days post-event)
STEP 3: Campaign setup with event template (3-5 days post-event)
STEP 4: Launch campaign (7-14 days post-event)
STEP 5: Reply management and qualification
STEP 6: Post-campaign analysis and optimization
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce campaign launch time from weeks to days
- Ensure consistent quality across all event campaigns
- Enable team members to execute without deep expertise
- Scale to 12-15 events per year (currently only 3 executed)

---

### 5. Investigate DEVCOM's 73.7% Interested Rate 🔬

**Current State:** DEVCOM achieved 73.7% interested rate - the highest across all three workspaces (Foundation, TeachAid, Coherence).

**Opportunity:** Understand what makes DEVCOM attendees so qualified, and replicate that audience quality.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Analyze DEVCOM attendee profiles (company size, role, game type)
- [ ] Compare to Gamescom profiles to identify differences
- [ ] Review email sequences for DEVCOM campaign (what copy was used?)
- [ ] Test hypothesis: DEVCOM has higher indie developer % who need Coherence more
- [ ] Prioritize similar regional European developer conferences
- [ ] Consider DEVCOM sponsorship for 2026 to get better quality lists

**Hypothesis to test:**
- DEVCOM attendees are more technical (developers vs. publishers)
- DEVCOM skews indie/small studio (better fit for Coherence pricing)
- European developers are more responsive to outreach
- DEVCOM timing aligns with Q3/Q4 planning cycles

**Expected Impact:**
- If DEVCOM audience quality can be replicated at scale, interested rate could jump from 45.9% average to 60-70%
- Better audience targeting = less wasted outreach on unqualified leads

---

### 6. Test Multiplayer-Focused Cold Outreach

**Current State:** Singleplayer developer campaign (#271) underperformed due to product-market mismatch.

**Opportunity:** Test cold outreach to developers actively building multiplayer games (not event-based).

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build list of developers working on multiplayer titles (Steam, App Store, etc.)
- [ ] Segment by game type (FPS, battle royale, co-op, MMO, etc.)
- [ ] Create multiplayer-specific value prop copy (not generic ROI)
- [ ] Test on 100-200 contacts to validate approach before scaling
- [ ] Compare performance to event-based campaigns

**Success Criteria:**
- Reply rate >10% (vs 3.64% for singleplayer)
- Interested rate >30% (vs 12.5% for singleplayer)
- If successful, this provides a scalable cold outreach channel between events

## Final Summary: The Coherence Winning Formula

### What Works ✅
1. **Event-based targeting** (Gamescom, DEVCOM, Cologne) → 15.59% reply rate, 56.6% interested rate
2. **1-2 week post-event timing** → Maximizes context relevance while fresh
3. **Developer conferences** → Technical audience matches Coherence's multiplayer focus
4. **Zero unsubscribes** → Messaging is respectful and relevant
5. **Open tracking OFF** → Consistent with best practices

### What Doesn't Work ❌
1. **Singleplayer developers** → 3.64% reply rate, 12.5% interested rate (product mismatch)
2. **Generic ROI messaging** → 6.07% average reply rate (62% worse than events)
3. **Unverified email lists** → 53% bounce rate destroyed DEVCOM reach
4. **Automated campaigns** → Performance dropped 41% vs manual approach

### The Playbook
```
TARGET: Gaming conference attendees (Gamescom, DEVCOM, GDC, Unite, PAX Dev)
TIMING: 7-14 days post-event
COPY: Event-specific context + Coherence value prop
LIST: Email verified (<5% bounce rate)
TECHNICAL: Open tracking OFF, plain text or HTML (both work)
THROTTLE: 300/day for event campaigns, 100 new leads/day
EXPECTED: 15-20% reply rate, 50-60% interested rate
```

### Next Level Opportunities
1. Scale to 12-15 events per year (currently only 3)
2. Solve list quality issues (could add 10-12 interested leads per campaign)
3. Investigate DEVCOM's 73.7% interested rate and replicate
4. Create standardized event playbook for rapid deployment
5. Test multiplayer-focused cold outreach as supplement
