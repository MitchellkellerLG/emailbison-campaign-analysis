## 🏆 Competitive Intelligence Summary

### Market Domination Strategy

- $60k/month grabs attention

### Vulnerabilities
- Limited infrastructure (15 accounts)
- Single person dependency (Ken)
- No moat beyond first-mover
- Easily replicable model

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSIGHTS

**The $60k Question:** Is this revenue claim realistic? If yes, massive opportunity. If no, credibility crisis awaits.

**Infrastructure Emergency:** 15 accounts cannot scale to meet demand. Every day without expansion = lost market share.

**The Reddit Gold Rush:** Launch Club struck gold early, but claims will be staked quickly. 90-day window to dominate before competition floods in.
