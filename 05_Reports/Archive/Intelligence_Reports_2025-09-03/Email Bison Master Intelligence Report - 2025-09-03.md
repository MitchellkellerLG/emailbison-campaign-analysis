## 🚨 MASTER INSIGHTS

### The $600k Question
Across 14 workspaces, over $600,000 annually burns on idle infrastructure while competitors capture market share. Immediate activation could 10x revenue overnight.

### The Event Arbitrage
Event-based campaigns consistently achieve 5-10x better results. Every workspace should prioritize conference/event attendee targeting immediately.

### The Personality Premium
Workspaces with strong founder personality (LeadGrow's Mitchell, Foundation's Ross) significantly outperform generic corporate messaging.

### The Infrastructure Paradox
More accounts ≠ better results. Launch Club achieves 9.5% reply rates with just 15 accounts while others fail with 400+.

### The Pivot Power
Sombra's gaming → financial services pivot in 30 days proves agility wins. Every workspace should test adjacent markets quarterly.
