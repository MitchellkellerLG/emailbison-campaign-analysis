## 🚨 CRITICAL INSIGHTS

**The $5,340/Month Question:** With 178 accounts burning cash daily, Jake needs to launch campaigns IMMEDIATELY. Every day without sending = pure loss.

**The Viral Optimist Paradox:** Claiming viral expertise without viral proof. First campaign must demonstrate actual viral capability or credibility crumbles.

**Infrastructure Overkill?** 178 accounts for personal brand seems excessive. Suggests either massive ambitions or poor planning. Time will tell.
