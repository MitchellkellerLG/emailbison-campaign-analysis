# New Zealand Curriculum Changes Research Report
**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of latest NZ curriculum changes to inform TeachAid campaign copy optimization
**Research Sources:** Ministry of Education (Tāhūrangi), ERO, RNZ, NZCER

---

## Executive Summary

New Zealand is in the midst of significant curriculum changes that are creating both urgency and controversy among school principals and teachers. The **updated Years 0-10 curriculum for English, Te Reo Rangatira, Mathematics and Statistics, and Pāngarau** was released October 19, 2025, with mandatory implementation starting **Term 1, 2026** (not 2025 as previously required).

**Key finding:** Over 650 principals have signed an open letter urging the Education Minister to **pause the rollout**, citing it as "too much, too fast, without enough support." This creates a critical opportunity for TeachAid to position as the solution to implementation challenges.

## Timeline of Changes (Corrected)

### Already Implemented (Term 1, 2025)
- **English (Years 0-6)** - Structured literacy approaches mandatory
- **Te Reo Rangatira (Years 0-6)**
- **Mathematics and Statistics (Years 0-8)** - Explicit teaching strategies mandatory
- **Pāngarau (Years 0-8)**
- **Requirement:** 1 hour per day on reading, writing, and maths

### Coming Soon (Term 1, 2026)
- **Updated/Final English (Years 0-10)** - Released Oct 19, 2025, changes made even to Years 0-8 content
- **Updated/Final Te Reo Rangatira (Years 0-10)**
- **Updated/Final Mathematics (Years 0-10)** - Including Years 9-10 now
- **Updated/Final Pāngarau (Years 0-10)**

**CRITICAL:** The October 2025 release made changes to ALREADY-IMPLEMENTED Years 0-8 content, meaning teachers who already adapted in early 2025 now have to adapt again for 2026.

### Future Implementation
- **Term 1, 2027:** Science, Social Sciences, Health & PE (Years 0-8)
- **Term 1, 2028:** The Arts, Technology, Learning Languages (Years 0-8)
- **2028-2030:** Years 11-13 curriculum rollout

## Current State: Principals' Frustrations

### The Open Letter (October 17, 2025)
**650 primary principals signed**, endorsed by:
- **Principals' Federation** (representing 2,000 principals)
- **NZEI union**
- **Te Akatea** (Māori principals' association)

### Key Complaints from Principals

**1. Rushed Implementation Without Tools**
- *"Expectations for rollout of big changes without having the proper tools already ready, like the assessment tools, everything is being built while it's being rolled out"* - Principal Tute Mila, Arakura School
- Principals hear about changes through media first, then scramble to get information
- No adequate time or resourcing

**2. Inadequate Professional Development**
- Only **3 days PLD** for structured literacy
- *"Three days PLD is woefully inadequate to create the kind of shifts in pedagogy"*
- Teachers who accessed PLD report it's useful, but there's not enough of it

**3. One-Size-Fits-All Approach**
- No provision for students with additional learning needs
- Schools developing adaptations themselves
- Uncertainty about adapting for neurodivergent or disabled learners

**4. Changes to Already-Implemented Content**
- Teachers adapted in early 2025 for Years 0-8
- October 2025 release changed that same content again
- *"I feel sorry for the teachers who have already worked on Years 0-8 in maths and 0-6 in English to find their curriculum content has changed"* - Facebook comment

**5. Small/Rural Schools Struggling Most**
- Only **69% of small schools have a plan for implementing English changes**
- Only **78% have someone leading delivery** (vs 90%+ for larger schools)
- Rural schools less likely to access PLD and resources

**3. Small Schools Still Struggle**
- Only **84% of small schools** have a plan for maths implementation
- Only **69% of small schools** have a plan for English implementation
- Less likely to have someone leading delivery

**4. Māori-Medium Provision Challenges**
- PLD, guidance, and resources don't reflect breadth of settings
- Teachers in rumaki often translate/adapt English-medium resources themselves
- Little change in what/how students are taught in Māori-medium settings

## Key Terminology & Concepts

### Structured Literacy Approaches
**What it is:** Evidence-based approach to teaching reading that emphasizes:
- Phonics (systematic and explicit)
- Phonological awareness
- Vocabulary
- Fluency
- Comprehension
- Writing craft

**Implementation requirement:** Mandatory from Term 1, 2025 for Years 0-6 English

**Teacher training:** 3 days PLD (principals say inadequate)

**Results so far:** Phonics checks show 58% of students at/above expectation (up from 36% in Term 1)

### Explicit Teaching Strategies
**What it is:** Teachers clearly explain concepts, model thinking, and provide structured practice

**Implementation:** Part of maths curriculum changes

**Teacher adoption:** Nearly all teachers (97%+) report using these strategies

### Te Mātaiaho Framework
**What it is:** Underlying curriculum framework that will support all learning areas from 2027

**Purpose:** Nationally consistent framework setting out essential knowledge every student should be taught

### Key Māori Concepts Referenced
- **Mana Whenua:** Connection to land, territorial rights
- **Ako:** Reciprocal teaching and learning
- **Mātauranga Māori:** Māori knowledge and ways of knowing

## Pain Points TeachAid Can Address

### 1. **Unit Planning Overload**
**The Problem:**
- Curriculum changed in early 2025
- Teachers adapted their unit plans
- October 2025 release changed content AGAIN (even for already-implemented years)

## Current Messaging Gaps in Winning Copy

The **19.5% reply rate campaign** from August was strong, but curriculum changes since then create new opportunities:

### What the Winning Copy Got Right ✅
- Referenced "new math and English curriculum changes" (still relevant)
- Mentioned Māori-specific teachings (Mana Whenua, Ako) (still critical)
- Emphasized time savings ("minutes" vs implied days/weekends) (even more relevant)
- Ministry of Education partnership credibility (still valuable)
- LATs (Limited Authority to Teach) teachers specifically (still accurate pain point)

### What's Changed Since August 🔄

**1. Curriculum Release Timing**
- **August copy said:** "new math and English curriculum changes"
- **Updated reality:** October 19, 2025 release changed ALREADY-IMPLEMENTED content
- **New pain:** Teachers adapted once in early 2025, now must adapt AGAIN for Term 1, 2026

**2. Implementation Timeline**
- **August copy implied:** Ongoing rollout
- **Updated reality:** **Mandatory Term 1, 2026** (2 months away in November)
- **New urgency:** Principals planning RIGHT NOW for January start

**3. Principal Frustration**
- **August context:** General implementation challenges
- **Updated reality:** 650 principals signed open letter, endorsed by 2,000+ principals
- **New positioning:** TeachAid as solution to system failures principals are publicly complaining about

**4. Specific Pain Points**
- **August copy:** Generic "teacher burnout" and "too much on their plate"
- **Updated reality:** Specific complaints about:
  - Assessment tools not ready
  - 3 days PLD inadequate
  - Changes to already-implemented content
  - One-size-fits-all approach
  - Small schools struggling most

**5. Results Evidence**
- **August copy:** Social proof ("1000s of educators using it")
- **New evidence available:** ERO report shows 54% teachers report improved achievement
- **Opportunity:** Position TeachAid as helping schools ACHIEVE the improvements ERO is tracking

## Recommendations for Copy Improvements

### Priority 1: Update Urgency & Timing
Reference the **October 2025 curriculum release** and **Term 1, 2026 mandatory implementation** to create immediate urgency for November/December decision-making.

### Priority 2: Acknowledge Principal Frustrations
Align with the 650+ principals' concerns - position TeachAid as the solution to system failures they're publicly complaining about.

### Priority 3: Emphasize "Double Adaptation" Pain
Teachers who already adapted in early 2025 must now adapt AGAIN for the October changes. TeachAid saves them from rebuilding everything manually.

### Priority 4: Target Small/Rural Schools
Call out the specific challenges small schools face (only 69-84% have implementation plans) and position TeachAid as the self-service solution.

### Priority 5: Add Assessment Components
Principals complain "assessment tools aren't ready" - emphasize that TeachAid units include assessment components.

## FastFest Context (For Copy Review)

The copy Mitchell provided appears to be for a **FastFest workshop** - a 45-minute session for senior leaders offered free.

**Current positioning:** AI tools for leaders (strategic plans, board reports) + unit planning for literacy/maths + School Policy Creator free gift

**Alignment with research:**
- ✅ Targets senior leaders (principals)
- ✅ Mentions unit plans for literacy & mathematics
- ✅ Offers free value (reduces barrier during budget constraints)
- ✅ Multiple session times (accommodates busy schedules)
- ⚠️ Doesn't mention Term 1, 2026 deadline urgency
- ⚠️ Doesn't acknowledge principal frustrations with rollout
- ⚠️ Doesn't differentiate from Ministry PLD (why attend this vs Ministry workshops?)
- ⚠️ "Structured approaches" is vague - could be more specific about structured literacy
