Dear XXXXX,

It's nearly the end of the year and as you're thinking about how to maximise your time (and maximise the impact of your team), I'm inviting you to join our 45-minute FastFest, with leaders from across the motu.

Join me, Dr Craig Hansen, Aotearoa's New Zealand's leading voice in AI and equity.

During this tight 45-minute session we will share how senior leaders can:
1. increase consistency when creating unit plans & teaching materials using AI for literacy & mathematics (structured approaches),
2. core tools for leader-level tasks (strategic plans, board reports etc.), and
3. save hours on reports & analysis.

This session is offered to you free, so you can make decisions as you close our 2025.

PLUS, you'll get access to the School Policy Creator for free!

Sign up here - it's online, 45 mins fast, multiple times available for you to choose what suits you, via Google Meeting.

See you there,
Dr Craig Hansen

## Key Problems with Current Copy

### 1. **No Curriculum Urgency**
- Doesn't mention October 2025 curriculum release
- Doesn't reference Term 1, 2026 mandatory implementation (2 months away)
- Generic "end of year" timing instead of specific crisis

### 2. **Doesn't Acknowledge Principal Pain**
- 650+ principals signed open letter in October 2025
- Principals publicly frustrated with "too much, too fast, without enough support"
- Copy doesn't position TeachAid as solution to THESE specific frustrations

### 3. **Vague Value Proposition**
- "Structured approaches" - what does this mean?
- "Increase consistency" - consistency with what? (Should be: compliance with updated curriculum)
- Doesn't differentiate from Ministry PLD

### 4. **Weak Opening Hook**
- "It's nearly the end of the year" - generic, not urgent
- "Maximise your time" - vague benefit
- Doesn't surface the ACUTE pain principals are feeling RIGHT NOW

### 5. **Wrong Positioning for Leader Tools**
- Leads with AI for strategic plans/board reports
- Unit planning for literacy/maths buried in middle
- But research shows unit planning is THE crisis principals face

### 6. **No Social Proof for THIS Context**
- Doesn't mention 1000s of NZ educators using TeachAid
- Doesn't reference schools already using it for curriculum implementation
- No proof that this solves the SPECIFIC October 2025 curriculum challenge

## Recommended Copy (Version A: Crisis-First)

**Subject:** Re: Term 1, 2026 curriculum implementation

```
Dear {FIRST_NAME},

650+ principals across Aotearoa just signed an open letter saying the curriculum rollout is "too much, too fast, without enough support."

You might be one of them.

The October curriculum release changed content that teachers ALREADY adapted in early 2025 - meaning your staff are rebuilding unit plans AGAIN for the Term 1, 2026 mandatory implementation (9 weeks away).

I'm running a free 45-minute FastFest to show you how schools are using AI to handle this exact problem:

**What we'll cover:**
1. Generate curriculum-aligned unit plans in minutes (not weekends) for the updated literacy & mathematics content - complete with structured literacy components and Māori-specific teachings like Mana Whenua and Ako
2. Adapt units for multi-year classrooms and diverse learners (the "one-size-fits-all" problem principals are complaining about)
3. Leader-level tools (strategic plans, board reports, assessment tracking)

**Who's already using this:**
1000s of NZ educators are generating units that match the October 2025 curriculum release - including slides, tests, and activities ready to deploy Term 1.

**Plus:** Everyone attending gets the School Policy Creator free.

Multiple times available via Google Meet - choose what works for your schedule.

This is free, no strings. Just 45 minutes to see if it helps you close out 2025 without your staff spending Christmas break rebuilding unit plans.

## Recommended Copy (Version B: Empathy-First)

**Subject:** You're not alone (650+ principals agree)

```
Dear {FIRST_NAME},

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the curriculum changes - you're not alone.

650 principals just signed an open letter to the Education Minister saying it's "too much, too fast, without enough support."

The October release changed Years 0-10 content (even stuff already implemented in early 2025), and now your teachers are scrambling to rebuild unit plans for the Term 1, 2026 start - 9 weeks away.

I get it. That's why I'm running a free 45-minute FastFest for principals and senior leaders.

**What you'll see:**
How schools across Aotearoa are using AI to generate curriculum-aligned units in minutes instead of weekends:

- Complete units for literacy & mathematics (structured literacy approaches built-in)
- Māori-specific teachings integrated (Mana Whenua, Ako)
- Adaptable for multi-year classrooms and diverse learners
- Includes slides, tests, activities - ready to deploy

**Plus tools for your senior leader work:**
Strategic plans, board reports, assessment analysis - hours saved.

**Who's using this:**
1000s of k-12 educators across NZ are already generating units aligned to the October 2025 curriculum release.

**Free gift:** School Policy Creator for everyone who attends.

Multiple session times via Google Meet - pick what suits you.

Free, 45 mins, no pressure. Just practical help before Term 1, 2026 hits.

## Recommended Copy (Version C: Tactical-First)

**Subject:** 9 weeks until mandatory curriculum rollout

```
Dear {FIRST_NAME},

Term 1, 2026 starts in 9 weeks.

That's when the October 2025 curriculum release becomes mandatory - the one that changed content your teachers ALREADY adapted in early 2025.

Which means your staff are rebuilding unit plans for:
- Updated literacy content (structured literacy approaches)
- Updated mathematics content (Years 0-10 now, not just 0-8)
- Māori-specific teachings (Mana Whenua, Ako)

On top of strategic plans, board reports, and end-of-year close-out.

I'm running a free 45-minute FastFest to show you the tool 1000s of NZ educators are using to handle exactly this:

**Generate curriculum-aligned units in minutes:**
- Complete with slides, tests, activities
- Structured literacy components built-in
- Adaptable for multi-year classrooms
- Assessment tracking included

**Plus leader-level AI tools:**
Strategic plans, board reports, analysis - hours saved.

Multiple times available via Google Meet. Choose what works.

**Free gift:** School Policy Creator for everyone attending.

This is about getting your team through Term 1, 2026 without spending Christmas break rebuilding everything manually.

Ngā mihi,

- ✅ Quotes their exact language: "too much, too fast, without enough support"
- ✅ Positions TeachAid as solution to system failures principals publicly complain about

### 3. **Made Value Proposition Specific**
- ✅ Changed "structured approaches" → "structured literacy components" (specific to curriculum requirement)
- ✅ Changed "increase consistency" → "generate curriculum-aligned units" (clear outcome)
- ✅ Added "multi-year classrooms and diverse learners" (addresses "one-size-fits-all" complaint)

### 4. **Strengthened Opening Hook**
- ✅ Version A: "650+ principals just signed an open letter" (social proof + crisis)
- ✅ Version B: "You're not alone" (empathy + shared frustration)
- ✅ Version C: "9 weeks until mandatory rollout" (urgency + deadline)

### 5. **Reordered Value Hierarchy**
- ✅ Unit planning for literacy/maths FIRST (the acute crisis)
- ✅ Leader tools SECOND (nice-to-have, not urgent)
- ✅ Emphasizes curriculum alignment over generic AI benefits

### 6. **Added Relevant Social Proof**
- ✅ "1000s of NZ educators" using TeachAid (from winning campaign)

- ✅ "Ready to deploy Term 1" (proves it works for this exact timeline)

### 7. **Included Māori Context**
- ✅ Kept "Mana Whenua and Ako" (proven winner in August campaign)
- ✅ Positioned as integrated, not add-on
- ✅ Used "Ngā mihi" sign-off (culturally appropriate)

## Version Comparison & When to Use

### Version A: Crisis-First
**Best for:**
- Principals who signed the open letter
- Schools publicly frustrated with rollout
- Audience that resonates with problem-first messaging

**Tone:** Direct, validates frustration, offers relief

### Version B: Empathy-First
**Best for:**
- Principals feeling isolated or overwhelmed
- Relationship-building approach
- Audience that values emotional connection

**Tone:** Warm, understanding, "we're in this together"

### Version C: Tactical-First
**Best for:**
- Data-driven principals
- Schools already planning implementation
- Audience that values efficiency over emotion

**Tone:** Practical, deadline-focused, solution-oriented

---

## A/B Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Subject Line
- **Control:** "You're not alone (650+ principals agree)"
- **Variant A:** "9 weeks until mandatory curriculum rollout"
- **Variant B:** "Re: Term 1, 2026 curriculum implementation"

**Hypothesis:** Deadline urgency (Variant A) will outperform empathy (Control) for decision-makers

### Test 2: Opening Hook
- **Control:** "650+ principals just signed an open letter..."
- **Variant:** "Term 1, 2026 starts in 9 weeks..."

**Hypothesis:** Specific deadline outperforms social proof for urgency-driven action

### Test 3: Value Proposition Order
- **Control:** Unit planning FIRST, leader tools SECOND
- **Variant:** Leader tools FIRST, unit planning SECOND

**Hypothesis:** Control (unit planning first) will outperform because it's the acute crisis

---

## Additional Enhancements to Consider

### 1. **Add "Small Schools" Variant**
Research shows small schools struggling most (only 69-84% have implementation plans).

**Possible hook:**
"If you're leading a small school, you know the October curriculum rollout is harder for you - only 69% of small schools have a plan for implementing the English changes. Here's how schools like yours are handling it..."

### 2. **Add "Rural Schools" Variant**
Rural schools less likely to access PLD and peer networks.

**Possible hook:**
"Rural schools are getting less support for the curriculum rollout (less access to Ministry PLD, fewer peer networks nearby). That's why 1000s of rural educators are using TeachAid - it's self-service, works from anywhere..."

### 3. **Add "Māori-Medium" Variant**
Research shows Māori-medium settings struggling with English-medium resources.

**Possible hook:**
"If you lead a rumaki or kura, you know the curriculum resources don't reflect your setting. Teachers are translating English-medium PLD themselves. TeachAid was designed WITH Māori education experts..."

### 4. **Add Post-FastFest Sequence**
For attendees who don't convert immediately:

**Follow-up 1 (3 days later):**
"How are your unit plans coming along for Term 1, 2026? Here's the recording from FastFest if you missed anything..."

**Follow-up 2 (Week before Term 1):**
"Term 1, 2026 starts Monday. Last chance to get your units ready - here's a 30-day free trial..."

---

## Final Recommendations

### Priority 1: USE VERSION C (Tactical-First)
- Strongest opening hook (specific deadline)
- Most relevant for November timing (9 weeks until Term 1)
- Clearest value proposition

### Priority 2: A/B TEST subject lines
- Test urgency ("9 weeks") vs empathy ("You're not alone") vs authority ("Re: Term 1, 2026")

### Priority 3: ADD small schools variant
- 69-84% of small schools lack implementation plans
- Self-service positioning resonates most

### Priority 4: CREATE post-FastFest sequence
- Not everyone will convert during workshop
- Follow-up with deadline reminders (Term 1 approaching)

### Priority 5: TRACK which principals are most engaged
- Did they attend FastFest?
- Did they download Policy Creator?
- Did they ask questions about curriculum alignment?
- Use engagement to prioritize follow-up
