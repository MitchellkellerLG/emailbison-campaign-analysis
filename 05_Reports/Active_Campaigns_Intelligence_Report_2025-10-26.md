**OPTIONS:**
1. **Pause & Reassess:** Stop campaign, refine copy/targeting, relaunch
2. **A/B Test While Running:** Test new subject lines on remaining leads
3. **Continue Monitoring:** Give it another week, reassess if no improvement

**RECOMMENDATION:** Pause and reassess. 14 days of low-performing work = wasted opportunity cost.
