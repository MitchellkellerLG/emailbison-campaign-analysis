   - Consider reactivating Campaign 170 to process remaining leads

   - Create follow-up sequences specifically for engaged leads
   - Set up alerts for replies that haven't been processed within 24-48 hours

3. **Lead Recovery Strategy**:
   - Export list of all leads who replied but aren't marked as interested
   - Create a targeted re-engagement campaign for these warm leads
   - Prioritize based on recency of engagement
