## Key Insights from Email Sequences

### What's Working:
1. **Cultural Relevance**: Māori-specific content (Mana Whenua, Ako) resonates strongly in NZ
2. **Regulatory Pressure**: Ontario's back-to-basics mandate and 2026 financial literacy deadline
3. **Local Success Stories**: Peel District pilot mentioned repeatedly for Ontario campaigns
4. **Direct Value Proposition**: Campaign 256's simple "unit on the house" had 50% interested rate

### Email Pattern Analysis:
- **Subject Lines**: Simple and direct ("curriculum rollouts", "district pilot", "Māori curricular unit")
- **Opening Lines**: "Weird/odd question" pattern to grab attention
- **Personalization**: Uses {FIRST_NAME}, {COMPANY}, {COLLEAGUE_1} variables
- **Follow-up Strategy**: 3-4 email sequences with 1-3 day waits
- **Thread Replies**: Later emails reply to original thread to maintain context

### Likely Reply Categories (Based on Performance):

#### Positive Indicators (Leading to "Interested"):
- Questions about implementation timeline
- Requests for demos or pilots
- Forwarding to curriculum teams
- Specific feature inquiries (Māori content, back-to-basics alignment)

#### Negative Responses (High reply, low interest):
- Budget constraints
- Already have solutions
- Not decision maker
- Timing issues (mid-year, already planned)
- General skepticism about AI in education

### Recommendations:
1. **Double down on Campaign 256 approach**: Simple, direct value prop
2. **Emphasize regulatory compliance** for Ontario (2026 deadline urgency)
3. **Lead with cultural elements** for New Zealand markets
4. **Test shorter sequences** - Campaign 256 had fewer emails but better conversion
5. **Consider segmenting** by school size or specific pain points
