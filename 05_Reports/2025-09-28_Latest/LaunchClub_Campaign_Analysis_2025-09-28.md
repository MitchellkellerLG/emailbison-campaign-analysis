{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}
```

**Why it works:**
- Ultra-short (one sentence)
- Value-first approach

- Low commitment ask

**Email 2 - The Explanation:**
```
Subject: Re: reddit's hidden value

{Looking back|Thinking about it|On reflection|In hindsight} I {coulda|could have|should have} {explained better|explained it more clearly|done a better job explaining} {FIRST_NAME} - basically the report {breaks down|shows|lays out|outlines} Reddit traffic opportunities based on {searches you currently rank for|your existing rankings|the keywords you already rank on|your current search positions}. It'll {tell you|show you|point out} what subreddits to {target|focus on|go after} and {posts to make|content to publish|types of posts to create} to {generate conversions|drive conversions|get results} from Reddit and {visitors from LLMs|traffic via LLMs|LLM-driven visitors}.

{If it'll help lmk|If you think it's useful let me know|If that sounds helpful give me a shout} and I'll {throw it together|put it together|get it ready} asap.
```

**Email 3 - Social Proof & Redirect:**
```
Subject: Re: reddit's hidden value

{Hey|Hi|Hello} {FIRST_NAME}, {we've done|we've completed|we've run} about 10 of these {this week|over the past week|in the last few days} and the results have been {pretty exciting|really promising|quite impressive}.

Several brands {walked away with|came out of it with|ended up with}:
- 10 priority subreddits to post in

```

### 🎯 Product Hunt Campaign (Moderate Success)

**Email 1:**
```
Subject: customer hunting

{Hi|Hey|Hello} {FIRST_NAME} - I {saw|noticed|spotted} {COMPANY} was on Product Hunt {recently|not long ago|a while back}. {Pretty cool|Really cool|Very cool} to see {a tool that {HOOK}|something that {HOOK}|a product that {HOOK}}.

{Interested|Sound good|Worth exploring}?
```

**Clever wordplay on "hunting" resonates with Product Hunt audience**

### 💸 White-Label Partnership Angle

**Email snippet from high-performing campaigns:**
```
"I work with 50+ agencies and independent consultants, white-labeling our traffic generation techniques (one partner is making an additional 60k+ monthly)"
```

**This social proof element appears in multiple successful campaigns**

## Key Insights & Patterns

### What's Working:
1. **Reddit positioning** - Timely with Google-Reddit partnership
2. **Free value offers** - Reports and audits vs. direct pitches
3. **Casual, conversational tone** - "coulda," "lmk," informal language
4. **Specific metrics** - "10-30k visitors," "60k monthly"
5. **White-label opportunities** - Strong angle for agencies
6. **Multi-step sequences** - Building value across 3-4 emails

### What's Failing:
1. **Financial services messaging** - 0% interest rate
2. **Generic outreach** - Without specific value props
3. **Single-email campaigns** - All winners use sequences
4. **Overly formal tone** - Best performers use casual language

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. SCALE WINNERS IMMEDIATELY
- **Evergreen SEO campaign** at only 28% - huge upside
- Clone Reddit angle for new verticals
- Increase daily send volume on proven campaigns

### 2. KILL OR PIVOT LOSERS

Based on success patterns:
- "Reddit Opportunities for E-commerce"

- "Reddit Growth for Recent YC Companies"

### 5. MESSAGING OPTIMIZATION
