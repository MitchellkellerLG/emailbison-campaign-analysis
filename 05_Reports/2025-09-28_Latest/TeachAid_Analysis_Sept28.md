### Positive Trends:
1. **New Zealand campaigns** showing exceptional engagement (15.4% reply rate for principals, 2.4% interested rate for teachers)
2. Active campaigns maintaining consistent daily sending volumes
3. Low bounce rates across all campaigns (<2%)

### Areas of Concern:
1. **BOCES campaign** was paused immediately after launch - needs investigation
2. No campaigns using open tracking (all set to false)
3. Several draft campaigns sitting idle since August

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate BOCES pause**: Determine why the newest campaign was paused after only 2 emails
2. **Capitalize on NZ success**: Consider expanding New Zealand outreach given high engagement
3. **Launch draft campaigns**: Multiple campaigns created in August remain in draft status
4. **Enable tracking**: Consider enabling open tracking for better metrics
5. **Follow up on interested leads**: 5 interested leads need immediate attention

## 7. Next Steps Priority
1. Review and respond to 5 interested leads
2. Investigate BOCES campaign pause reason
3. Plan expansion of successful New Zealand approach
4. Activate high-potential draft campaigns
5. Review paused Ontario campaign for potential reactivation
