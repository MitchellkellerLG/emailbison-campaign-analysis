{Was thinking more on this|Gave this some more thought|Been thinking further about this|Had a minute to think more on this|Thought more about this} {FIRST_NAME} - and was wondering how you're currently tackling production AI? 

We've been {supporting|working with|helping|collaborating with} teams at {Google, BBVA, and Berkeley Research|Berkeley Research, BBVA, and Google|Google and BBVA along with Berkeley Research} to bring error rates {below 5%|down under 5%|to less than five percent|under the 5% mark} in {weeks instead of months|a matter of weeks|weeks rather than months|just weeks}.

We do this by: 

- Automating error detection
- stopping and fixing them before they go viral
- scoring and improving labeling to train systems faster without manual intervention

{FIRST_NAME} - one of the interesting things lately on our end is how we helped Poncle build out multiplayer for vampire survivors.

managed to do it with:

- {No|Zero} dedicated netcode engineers
- without compromosing their single player experience
- and in about half the time

Figured it'd be fun to chat about some of our findings at Develop Brighton if you're going as well. 

If not I can go kick rocks hahaha:)

#### Email 1 - Subject: "{IP potential|portfolio review}"
**Wait Days:** 1
```
Hey {FIRST_NAME} - how do you know you're not sitting on multiplayer goldmines in your current single-player catalog?

We're helping Devolver Digital spot underutilized IP in their portfolio that could result in meaningful revenue from a simple multiplayer addition.

{HOOK_2}

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}
```

#### Email 2 - Subject: "Re: portfolio review" (Thread Reply)
**Wait Days:** 3
```
{FIRST_NAME} - I sent you an email about spotting underutilized IPs in your portfolio, but likely didn't do the best job explaining how.

We're seeing a fundamental shift in the industry: 74% of EA's revenue now comes from live services rather than one-time purchases, and 60% of all gaming time in 2023 was spent on live-service games over 6 years old. This means publishers with existing catalogs are sitting on potential goldmines.

Our 8-phase assessment framework identifies which titles in your portfolio could become recurring revenue engines with strategic multiplayer additions and the feasibility of doing it.

Most publishers discover 2-3 games with significant revenue potential.

Worth seeing if there's anything untapped in your catalog?

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. We recently helped Vampire Survivors add multiplayer features without them hiring additional developers or netcode engineers - we handled the entire technical implementation quickly and cost-effectively.

Hi {FIRST_NAME} - Touched base a few times about the exciting things we're doing for publishers like Devolver Digital by spotting their underutilized IPs and turning them into fresh revenue.

We're doing these portfolio assessments on the house, is there anyone on the team that would be worth sharing more info about this with?

{Hey|Hello} {FIRST_NAME}, so that opportunity I mentioned for {HOOK_2}...

AI research like {HOOK} needs serious compute power. Here's what I mean: if you're spending $10k/month on GPU infrastructure now, that same budget gets you {about|roughly} $27k worth of compute capacity in Quebec.

Spending $30k? That becomes {around $81k|$81k} in GPU power.

We {actually|often} do AI scaling assessments to show {exactly|precisely} how much more compute you'd get for your current spend.

{Google, Perplexity, and GPT|GPT, Perplexity, and Google|AI platforms like Google, GPT, and Perplexity} all let Reddit {answer|show up in|surface answers for} around {20+%|over 20%|roughly one-fifth} of AI searches for {product-led queries|buying-intent queries|product-focused searches}.

Meanwhile, Reddit accounts for almost {600m site visitors each month|600m visitors each month|close to 600m site visitors each month} and platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram aren't far behind. 

Think about what this means: Your potential customers are {reading random Reddit posts|seeing unvetted Reddit threads|consuming content from strangers on Reddit} about your product instead of your own content. ({That means buying decisions based on what strangers say on Reddit.|Which means strangers on Reddit influence their buying decisions.|So buyers are deciding based on Reddit chatter, not your message.}) and same goes for the other platforms. 

That's why our founder Ross Simmonds {spent ages|put in a lot of time|dedicated significant effort} {throwing together|building|creating} a full report on LLM ranking in 2025.

It it helps, we can {pass around|share|send over} a few {ideas|strategies|approaches} on how you can start {deploying|repurposing|rolling out} your best-performing content on {Reddit, LinkedIn, and more|LinkedIn, Reddit, and other platforms|Reddit and LinkedIn (plus more)} so can stop missing out on high-intent visitors from LLMs.

Also {FIRST_NAME} {Kind of forgot to mention|Almost left this out|Just realized I didn't mention}, 1000s of k-12 {educators|teaching staff members|teachers} across {New Zealand|NZ|Aotearoa} are already using it to {generate|deploy|set up|create} complete curricular units that:

- match pedagogy and Ministry standards
- complete with slides, tests and activities that integrate with google slides or anything else.
- and even Māori specific lesson ideas like Mana Whenua and Ako

If you're open to trying it out, we can setup {COMPANY} on a free pilot for 30 days. 

Do you think your teaching staff might be interested generating units in minutes instead of days?

Hello {FIRST_NAME}, I know you're definitely very busy, so instead of adding more to your plate,  
would it make sense for me to connect directly with someone on your team?  

I'd be happy to provide a complimentary 30-day pilot so they can build out units right away, no strings attached, and keep everything they create.  

Should I set that up for your staff, or point it to the right person on your team?

Hey {FIRST_NAME} done any experimenting with intent signals?

A lot of team's we speak with seem to confuse intent with "they want you" and end up sending a message that borders on restraining order levels of creepy. (like a waitress flirting, it's not often cause they like you) 

{Really they're just an excuse to reach out|Honestly, they're just a reason to connect|Truth is, they're just a way to start the conversation|To be real, they're just a touchpoint to reach out}.

We use these to {generate|book|set up|secure} {dozens of|a steady stream of|consistent} quality meetings for our clients each month.

If you're {open to ideas|interested in hearing a few|open to exploring|keen to see what's possible}, we might be able to {surface|share|highlight|uncover} a few to {let you do the same|replicate similar results|make this work for you|achieve the same outcome}.

Howdy {FIRST_NAME} - the message from a 2 days back might not have made the most sense without context - so while being at risk of an inbox restraining order from yourself I wanted to share some reasons why you might want a strategy from silly ol' me. 

In the last month, using intent-based campaigns we've:

- {Booked|Secured|Set up} 1 client over 40 meetings with mutual event attendees
- {Helped another|Supported another|Worked with another client who} {booked|scheduled|locked in} 4 calls for {>100k deal sizes|deals over 100k|six-figure opportunities} with companies opening new greenhouses
- {Another|One more client} {locked in|secured|booked} meetings with 7 companies of {300+ employees|over 300 staff|more than 300 people} in a saturated market off their web visitors
- Not to mention a {7500/m|$7.5k per month|7,500 monthly} retainer we sourced by {contacting|reaching out to|engaging} someone {liking LinkedIn posts|interacting with LinkedIn content|engaging with posts on LinkedIn} about something similar to their service

And {another|one more} {closed|secured|won} a 3-month retainer in just 6 days

And the list goes on.

Of course, these aren't the only campaigns we run, but they are {helpful|a good example|worth highlighting}.

What we want to do is {throw together|build|put together|create} something {comprehensive|end-to-end|well-rounded|detailed} so you can {do something similar|replicate this|achieve similar results|run comparable campaigns}.

{You up for it?|Interested?|Want to give it a go?|Would you like to explore it?}

lmk thanks

{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}

P.S. a lot of teams replace their oddly high zoom info spend with us and get end to end support.
