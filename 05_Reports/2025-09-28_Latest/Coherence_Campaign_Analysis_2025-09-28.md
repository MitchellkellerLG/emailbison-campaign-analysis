## Campaign Performance Patterns

### By Campaign Type:
1. **Event Attendees**: 8-20% interested rates
2. **Publisher Lists**: 3-4% interested rates  
3. **Developer Lists**: 1-2% interested rates
4. **Geographic Specific**: Mixed results

### By Messaging Angle:
1. **Case Study Led**: Highest engagement
2. **Portfolio Review**: Good for publishers
3. **Technical Benefits**: Lower conversion
4. **Generic Multiplayer**: Poor results

## Key Insights

### What's Working:
1. **Event-based targeting** - 5x better than cold outreach
2. **Vampire Survivors story** - Instant credibility
3. **Free assessment offers** - Low commitment, high value
4. **Gaming culture references** - "ggwp", ":)" emoticons
5. **AAA team credentials** - Crytek/Ubisoft mentions

### What's Not Working:
1. **Generic publisher outreach** without personalization
2. **Technical-first messaging** without business case
3. **Long email sequences** (best results in first 2 emails)
4. **Geographic campaigns** (e.g., "USA Game Publishers")

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. EVENT STRATEGY DOMINANCE
- Map all 2025 gaming conferences NOW
- Launch campaigns 2-3 weeks before events
- Reference specific talks/demos attendees saw
- Follow up within 1 week post-event

### 2. EXPAND CASE STUDY LIBRARY
Current dependency on single case study is risky:
- Document 2-3 more success stories
- Create genre-specific versions
- Include specific metrics (time saved, revenue gained)

### 3. SEGMENT BY COMPANY PROFILE
- **AAA Publishers**: Portfolio review angle
- **Indie Developers**: Cost/time savings angle
- **Mid-size Studios**: Competitive advantage angle
- **Mobile Developers**: Retention/monetization angle

### 4. NEW CAMPAIGN CONCEPTS
Based on winners:
- "GDC 2025 Multiplayer Track Attendees"
- "Steam Next Fest Participants - Add Multiplayer"
- "Unity Asset Store Developers - Coherence Integration"
- "Failed Multiplayer Games - Second Chance"

### 5. TESTING PRIORITIES
- Subject lines: "vampire survivors" vs company-specific game
- First touch: Event reference vs direct value prop
- Offers: Free assessment vs technical demo vs strategy call
- Timing: Pre-event vs during vs post-event

## 90-Day Growth Plan

### Month 1: Optimize Current
- A/B test subject lines on active campaign
- Create 2 new case studies from 82 interested leads
- Plan Q4 2025 conference calendar

### Month 2: Scale Winners  
- Launch 5 event-specific campaigns
- Test portfolio review on mobile publishers
- Develop automated assessment tool

### Month 3: Expand Reach
- Test new verticals (VR, blockchain gaming)
- Create partnership campaigns with Unity/Unreal
- Build referral program from happy clients

## Performance Projections

**Current Performance:**
- 82 total interested leads
- Best campaign: 20.83% interested rate
- Average: ~5% interested rate

**Optimized Projections:**
- Focus on event campaigns only
- Target: 10% average interested rate
- Monthly target: 30 interested leads
- Annual projection: 360 qualified opportunities

## Critical Success Factors

1. **List Quality** - DEVCOM campaign had 98 bounces
2. **Timing** - Event campaigns must launch pre-event
3. **Case Study Dependency** - Need more examples ASAP
4. **Decision Maker Targeting** - CTO/Technical Directors convert best

## Conclusion

Coherence has discovered a powerful formula: event-based outreach + strong case study + free value offer = exceptional conversion rates. The 20.83% interested rate from Brighton Develop proves the model works. The immediate priority is to systematize event campaigns while diversifying case studies to reduce dependency on Vampire Survivors.

With proper execution of the event strategy alone, Coherence could generate 300+ qualified leads annually from a relatively small target market. The path to growth is clear: follow the gaming conference circuit with personalized, value-driven outreach.
