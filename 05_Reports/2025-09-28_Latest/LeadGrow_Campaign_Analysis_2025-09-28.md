## Email Sequence Analysis

### Event Campaign Template (All Similar)

**Email 1 - Main Variant:**
```
Subject: Attending {Event Names}?

{Hi|Hey|Hello} {FIRST_NAME},

Are you attending events like [specific events] to meet {HOOK} leaders?

If {so|that's the case}, how are you {pre-setting|scheduling|booking} meetings with people {before the event|ahead of the event}?

We {scrape|extract data from|pull contacts from} event portals and apps, qualify contacts and {preset|set up} dozens of meetings via outbound.

Do you think {something like this|a process like this|this kind of approach} would {help you close more deals|increase your close rate} from events?
```

**Email 1 - A/B Test Variant:**
```
Subject: Attending {Event Names}?

{Hi|Hey|Hello} {FIRST_NAME},

Are you attending events like [specific events] to meet {HOOK} leaders?

If {so|that's the case|that's true}, I might have a {pretty wild|really interesting} opportunity for you.
```

**Email 2 - The Explanation:**
```
Subject: Re: Attending {Event Names}?

Sorry {FIRST_NAME}, I didn't really explain why we do this.

A lot of teams we work with {noticed|have found|realized} that events can be {hit or miss|unpredictable}. Sometimes you {run into the right people|meet great prospects|connect with ideal prospects}, sometimes you {don't|get nothing useful|walk away empty-handed}.

So we started {scraping|pulling data from} event networking apps, and {monitoring|tracking} LinkedIn for people attending based on their posts, then {qualifying and scoring them out|scoring and qualifying them} so every event {brought|led to} meaningful sales conversations.

The results have been {pretty wild|honestly surprising}.

1 client is about to be acquired after {generating|booking} 100's of sales calls this year from events alone. Not completely sure if this could be {similar for you|a fit for you}.

But if events are on your team's radar, would you be open to a {brief|quick|short} conversation on how to {make the most of them|get better ROI from them|maximize them}?

Let me know {either way|what you think|your thoughts},
```

**Email 3 - Brief Nudge:**
```
Subject: Re: Attending {Event Names}?

Hey {FIRST_NAME} - totally get if this is a no, 

but would still love to know if you think would generate quality meetings from events using my method

Or is there something that's a higher priority for you now?
```

### M&A Campaign - "Pipeline on Ozempic"

**Email 1 - The Hook:**
```
Subject: pipeline on ozempic?

Hey {FIRST_NAME} - {HOOK}

We recently helped a seed funded startup go from pre-rev to 320k earned entirely through outbound in 6 months

Would it be crazy if I recorded a quick video that shows you how you could use the 3 simple strategies that helped them - so you can lock in 1-2 additional merger and acquisition clients monthly?

lmk either way,

P.S. They operate with 3 month sales cycles & just kidding with the ozempic stuff hahaha:)
```

**Email 4 - New Addition (September 2025):**
```
Subject: valuable stalking

Hey {FIRST_NAME} - Are you doing any sell side atm?

If so, If I could find you founders nearing retirement age, first time founders thinking about their first exit, and people actively engaging with posts from influencers like Andrew Gazdecki (founder of acquired) - would that be worth a brief email exchange?

if that sounds awful just lmk and I'll plan for an exit.

P.S. It's kinda like stalking but usually prospect say thank you instead of serving you.
```

## Top Performing Campaigns (Historical)

### 🥇 Trigify Intent-based Leads (Campaign #103)
- **Reply Rate: 4.33%** (177/4,085 contacted)
- **Interested: 23** (0.83% rate - BEST IN WORKSPACE)
- Tagged: @Mitchell_LeadGrow
- Status: Paused

**Winning Email Copy:**
```
Subject: {restraining orders|they want you}

Hey {FIRST_NAME} done any experimenting with intent signals?

A lot of team's we speak with seem to confuse intent with "they want you" and end up sending a message that borders on restraining order levels of creepy. (like a waitress flirting, it's not often cause they like you)

{Really they're just an excuse to reach out|Honestly, they're just a reason to connect|Truth is, they're just a way to start the conversation|To be real, they're just a touchpoint to reach out}.

We use these to {generate|book|set up|secure} {dozens of|a steady stream of|consistent} quality meetings for our clients each month.

## Key Insights

### What's Working:
1. **Humor and Personality** - "Pipeline on ozempic," "valuable stalking"
2. **Intent-based Targeting** - Trigify campaign shows highest conversion
3. **Specific ROI Stories** - "320k in 6 months" provides concrete value
4. **Creative Subject Lines** - Pattern interrupts like "restraining orders"

### What's Failing:
1. **Generic Event Messaging** - All September campaigns underperforming
2. **Lack of Personalization** - Event campaigns too similar across verticals
3. **Weak Value Props** - "Pre-setting meetings" not resonating
4. **Poor A/B Testing** - Variants too similar to provide insights

## Immediate Actions

### 1. PAUSE & PIVOT
- **Immediately pause** all September event campaigns (244-247)
- Reallocate budget to proven performers
- Save team resources for what works

### 2. REVIVE WINNERS
- **Relaunch Trigify campaign** with increased volume
- Scale intent-based approach across new verticals
- Test "restraining orders" messaging in other contexts

### 3. ENHANCE M&A CAMPAIGN
- Add more "valuable stalking" type sequences
- Test video offers in other campaigns
- Create industry-specific ROI stories

### 4. NEW CAMPAIGN IDEAS
Based on winning patterns:
- "Intent signals for [Industry]" campaigns
- "Pipeline transformation" series
- Humor-driven sequences for conservative industries

### 5. TESTING PRIORITIES
- Subject lines with humor/intrigue
- Shorter first emails (under 50 words)
- More specific pain points vs generic benefits

## 90-Day Projection

**Current State:**
- Active campaigns: 10
- Average interest rate: 0.20%
- Total interested leads: ~37

**Optimized State (with recommendations):**
- Focus on 5 high-performing campaigns
- Target interest rate: 0.80% (matching Trigify)
- Projected interested leads: 150+
- Revenue impact: 4x current pipeline

The data clearly shows creative, intent-based messaging dramatically outperforms generic event outreach. Time to cut the dead weight and double down on what drives real results.
