## OPPORTUNITIES

1. **Reactivate "Databricks Post Engagers"**

   - 534 remaining leads
   - Could run for ~2 days at current pace

2. **Rerun "CSAT IC Hires" with Better Qualification**
   - 2.34% reply rate is excellent
   - Issue is qualification, not copy/targeting
   - Potential to generate more interested leads

3. **Launch Draft Campaigns**
   - 2 draft campaigns ready to go
   - Fresh lead sources available

## PORTFOLIO HEALTH SCORE: 6/10

**Strengths:**
- Campaign #319 showing strong 2.34% reply rate
- Active campaigns completing on schedule
- Plain text format working well

**Weaknesses:**
- Low interested conversion (3 interested from 85 replies = 3.5%)
- All active campaigns finishing simultaneously (gap risk)
- Too many paused campaigns (6) indicating testing without optimization
- No pipeline of ready-to-launch campaigns

**Forecast:**
- **Next 7 Days:** All active campaigns complete, workspace goes idle
- **Immediate Need:** Queue 2-3 new campaigns to maintain momentum
