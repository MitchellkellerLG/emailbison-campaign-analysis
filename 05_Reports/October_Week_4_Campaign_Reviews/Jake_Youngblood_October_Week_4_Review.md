Here are 3 quick ways {COMPANY} could be included:

**UNDERPERFORMING**
- **Subsequence campaigns #309, #310, #320:** Little to no activity (0-1 leads contacted)

### Key Insights

1. **The "Guinness World Record" hook is highly effective** across all active outbound campaigns
2. **Casual, non-salesy tone** consistently outperforms formal approaches
3. **Social proof metrics** (view counts, follower numbers) build credibility fast
4. **GoPro partnership mention** serves as powerful third-party validation
5. **Low-friction CTAs** ("email exchange" vs "call") increase engagement
6. **Referral requests in Step 3** are effective at maintaining conversations

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Week 4)

1. **Launch Campaign #288 (JVDB Electronics)**
   - All sequence copy is complete and tested
   - Upload leads and set schedule
   - Expected reply rate: 4-6% based on similar campaigns

2. **Consolidate Subsequence Campaigns**
   - Campaigns #309, #310, #320 have minimal activity
   - Consider merging into a single unified followup sequence
   - Review lead lists to ensure proper routing

3. **Scale Top Performers**
   - Campaign #274 has nearly completed (98.11%)
   - Build lookalike audience and launch "Jake Exa Brand Retail Travel - V2"
   - Campaign #251 is only 46% complete - ensure consistent daily sending

4. **Reply Management**
   - 461 unique replies require response/categorization
   - 53 interested leads should be prioritized for qualification
   - Set up dedicated time for inbox management

#### Content Optimization (Next 30 Days)

1. **Test New Subject Line Variants**
   - Current emoji subjects perform well but test:
     - "quick partnership question"
     - "GoPro collab - similar opportunity"
     - "{COMPANY} x Guinness World Record"

2. **Expand Integration Examples**
   - Create industry-specific Step 2 variants:
     - Apparel brands (branded gear worn during jumps)
     - Tech accessories (power banks, headphones featured)
     - Supplements (energy/recovery products)

3. **Add Video/Visual Assets**
   - Reference in Step 3: "happy to send over a quick video showing what this looks like"
   - Create 30-second demo reel for interested prospects

4. **A/B Test Metric Strength**
   - Test "100m views" vs specific engagement numbers
   - Test community size emphasis vs view count emphasis

#### Lead Management & Scaling

1. **List Building Priorities**
   - Campaign #274 needs fresh leads (only 15 remaining)
   - Campaign #277 needs 2,500+ new ecom brand contacts
   - Build 5,000+ electronics/tech brand list for Campaign #288

2. **Segmentation Strategy**
   - Tag interested leads by industry vertical
   - Create custom followup sequences by objection type
   - Separate "not interested" from "wrong person" replies

3. **Deliverability Maintenance**
   - Current bounce rate: 0.88% (excellent)
   - Monitor sender reputation across all domains
   - Maintain 450 emails/day limit to preserve deliverability

#### Measurement & Reporting

1. **Weekly KPI Tracking**
   - Reply rate by campaign
   - Interested lead conversion rate
   - Days to first reply
   - Best performing subject line variants

2. **Monthly Performance Reviews**
   - Campaign ROI analysis
   - Copy performance trends
   - Industry vertical benchmarking

3. **Conversion Path Analysis**
   - Track interested leads → meetings → partnerships
   - Identify common objections/blockers
   - Refine qualification criteria

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Open Tracking Disabled**
   - All campaigns have open tracking OFF (good for deliverability)
   - Rely on reply rate as primary engagement metric

2. **Plain Text Format**
   - Outbound campaigns use plain text (deliverability best practice)
   - Subsequence campaigns use HTML - monitor performance difference

3. **No Unsubscribe Link**
   - All campaigns have unsubscribe disabled
   - Risk: potential spam complaints
   - Mitigation: "lmk either way" gives opt-out option

### 30-Day Forecast

**Expected Results (Based on Current Performance):**
- **Total Emails Sent:** 35,000+
- **Expected Replies:** 1,750-2,100 (5% avg reply rate)
- **Interested Leads:** 210-280 (0.6% avg interested rate)
- **Potential Partnerships:** 5-10 (assuming 2-5% conversion from interested)

**Resource Requirements:**
- 2-3 hours/day for reply management
- Weekly lead list uploads (1,500-2,000 leads/week)
- Monthly copy refresh/optimization (4 hours)

### Final Notes

Jake Youngblood's campaigns demonstrate a strong understanding of creator economy positioning and partnership sales. The consistent messaging around the Guinness World Record attempt, social proof, and low-friction engagement creates an effective outbound system.

**Top Priority:** Launch Campaign #288 and build fresh lead lists for completing Campaigns #274 and #277. The infrastructure and copy are proven - now it's about volume and consistency.

**Biggest Opportunity:** The 53 interested leads represent immediate partnership potential. Prioritize qualification calls/deeper conversations with this segment.

**Watch Metric:** If reply rates drop below 4%, test new subject lines and opening hooks. Current performance is strong, but maintain vigilance on engagement trends.
