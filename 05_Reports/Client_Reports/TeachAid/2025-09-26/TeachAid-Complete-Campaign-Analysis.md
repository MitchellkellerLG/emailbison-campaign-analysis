Hello {FIRST_NAME}, I know you're definitely very busy, so instead of adding more to your plate, would it make sense for me to connect directly with someone on your team?

I'd be happy to provide a complimentary 30-day pilot so they can build out units right away, no strings attached, and keep everything they create.

Should I set that up for your staff, or point it to the right person on your team?

**ANALYSIS**: Strong focus on BC's 6 core competencies, addresses teacher shortage pain point, good use of social proof. The "coffee instead of weekend" line is memorable.
