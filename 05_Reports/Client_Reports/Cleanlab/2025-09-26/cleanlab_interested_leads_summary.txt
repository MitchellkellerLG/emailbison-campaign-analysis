Search Strategy:
----------------
Since the EmailBison API includes lead_campaign_data in each lead response, I need to:
1. Query the leads endpoint with pagination
2. Check each lead's lead_campaign_data array
3. Look for entries where campaign_id matches our targets AND interested=true
4. Extract the job titles from either the 'title' field or 'notes' field

Note: From the sample API responses, I can see that lead data includes:
- title: Usually null in many cases
- notes: Often contains the actual job title (e.g., "CEO", "Chief Information Officer")
- company: Company name
- first_name, last_name, email: Contact details
