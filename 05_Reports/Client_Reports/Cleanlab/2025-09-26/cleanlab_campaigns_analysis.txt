RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
To get the exact job titles of these 12 interested leads, you would need to:

1. Contact EmailBison support for assistance in extracting interested leads data
2. Use their web interface to filter and export interested leads
3. Check if there's a webhook or export feature for interested lead notifications
4. Use alternative API endpoints that might not be publicly documented

The API structure shows that the data exists (the 'interested' field is tracked per lead per campaign), but accessing it efficiently requires either:
- A specific filter parameter in the leads endpoint
- Access to a specialized reporting endpoint
- Direct database query access
