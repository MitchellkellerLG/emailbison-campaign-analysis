```
Google was hitting the same wall when training their voice assistant. 
Majority of their cycles burnt on manual QA instead of actual model 
improvements, completely draining their engineering bandwidth.

We ended up working with them on catching mislabeled datasets before 
training even started. Cut their manual work by 80+%.
