## Content Briefs Extracted

### Brief 2025-11-05-001: Lead Magnet Discovery Framework
**Post Type:** Tactical Guide (Middle of Funnel)
**Hook:** Most agencies create lead magnets from thin air - here's how to find lead magnets already hiding in your sales process

**Key Insight:** Mitchell's framework for identifying lead magnets - look at unpaid deliverables created before closing deals (audits, reports, analysis), productize those. Data vendors win by showing comparison reports, not generic whitepapers.

**Status:** Ready for writer ✅

---

### Brief 2025-11-05-002: 2-Question Qualification Framework
**Post Type:** Tactical Guide (Top of Funnel)
**Hook:** Your qualification criteria is costing you time - here's the 2-question framework we use to qualify every opportunity in under 60 seconds

**Key Insight:** Mitchell's 2 non-negotiable criteria: (1) LTV $5K+ per client, (2) Market of 20K+ companies. If NO to either, the math doesn't work.

**Status:** Ready for writer ✅

---

### Brief 2025-11-05-003: Content vs. Outbound Decision Framework
**Post Type:** Strategy Guide - Longform (Middle of Funnel)
**Hook:** When outbound isn't the answer - how to choose between content marketing and cold email (and why you might need both)

**Key Insight:** Mitchell honestly assessed Blue Labs and recommended content > outbound for their situation (enterprise targets, complex multi-stakeholder sales, high ticket). Outbound serves as messaging validation tool.

**Status:** Ready for writer ✅

---

### Brief 2025-11-05-004: Event Pre-Booking Strategy
**Post Type:** Tactical Guide (Top of Funnel)
**Hook:** Event ROI is broken - here's how to pre-book 20-40 meetings before the event even starts

**Key Insight:** Mitchell's approach - scrape event portals/apps for attendee lists, pre-book meetings with decision-makers BEFORE event. Data center client books 20-40 calls per event using this method.

**Status:** Ready for writer ✅

---

### Brief 2025-11-05-005: CRM Selection (Adio Personal Story)
**Post Type:** Tactical Guide / Tool Recommendation (Middle of Funnel)
**Hook:** CRM selection paralysis is costing you deals - here's why we switched from Close to Adio and booked 3 calls in the first week

**Key Insight:** Mitchell's personal story - switched to Adio, auto-enrichment surfaced forgotten contacts, booked 3 calls first week. Adio's killer feature: automatically ingests all historical email conversations.

**Status:** Ready for writer ✅

---

### Brief 2025-11-05-006: Intent Data Source Prioritization
**Post Type:** Tactical Guide (Top of Funnel)
**Hook:** Intent data from Reddit is a trap - here's where senior B2B executives actually engage

**Key Insight:** LinkedIn is where senior B2B executives engage professionally, not Reddit. Mitchell referenced booking LastPass, Apollo, major university via LinkedIn intent (lead magnet downloads, engagement).

**Status:** Needs validation - confirm LastPass/Apollo bookings were from LinkedIn intent data ⚠️

---

### Brief 2025-11-05-007: Enterprise Outbound Case Study
**Post Type:** Client Success Story OR Tactical Guide (Middle of Funnel)
**Hook:** Volume doesn't work for enterprise - here's how we helped a data center provider crack Fortune 500 accounts with 2 simple campaigns

**Key Insight:** Data center provider targeting Fortune 500 - Mitchell used (1) hiring signals ("cloud forecasting" roles), (2) event scraping (AI conferences). Results: 20-40 meetings per event.

**Status:** Needs client permission before publishing (even anonymized) ⚠️

## Notes for Mitchell

### Strong Content Opportunities
1. **Brief 003 (Content vs. Outbound)** - This challenges the "cold email works for everyone" narrative. Honest, positioning-forward. Recommend as longform strategy guide.

2. **Brief 001 (Lead Magnet Framework)** - Universal framework applicable to any service business. High shareability.

3. **Brief 004 (Event Pre-Booking)** - Solves real problem ($3K wasted on wrong events). Concrete results (20-40 meetings/event).

### Voice Consistency Notes
- Transcript shows Mitchell using plain English ("what customers pay you" vs. "LTV")
- Personal stories work (Adio CRM, 3 calls first week)
- Honest assessments build trust (told prospect content > outbound)
- Qualification framework is simple, defensible, memorable

### Potential Red Flags
- Brief 007 needs client permission (data center case study)
- Brief 006 needs validation (LastPass/Apollo wins via LinkedIn intent)
- Blue Labs must be anonymized across all content
