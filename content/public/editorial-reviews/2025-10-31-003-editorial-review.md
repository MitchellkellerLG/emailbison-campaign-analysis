## Step 1: Anonymization Verification (CRITICAL)

**Client-identifying information scan:**
- [ ] Client company names → NONE FOUND ✅
- [ ] Client personal names → NONE FOUND ✅
- [ ] Specific company details → NONE FOUND ✅
- [ ] Geographic identifiers → NONE FOUND ✅
- [ ] Internal project names → NONE FOUND ✅

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Zero client-identifying information detected

---

## Step 2: Quality Scoring (10-point scale)

### Voice (4 points max)

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Direct, conversational opening ("I turn down deals all the time.")
- ✅ Short sentences, 8th grade reading level
- ✅ Mitchell's natural phrasing ("cause" not "because", "Even if everything else looks perfect")
- ✅ Personal story format (real call examples, not universal advice)
- ✅ Shows selectivity/positioning without bragging ("Not to flex about saying no")
- ✅ Confident but experience-based ("The deals that clear these two bars? Those actually work.")
- ✅ Appropriate audience targeting (speaks TO founders evaluating cold email, not about agencies)

**Minor voice notes:**
- "His customers pay $500/month" - real, specific example
- "I used to say yes to everything" - vulnerable admission
- "Only lost 4 clients in 2025 and I fired 2 of them at month 2" - proof through specificity

**Voice Score: 4/4** (Perfect Mitchell voice - personal, conversational, proof-driven)

---

### Technical (3 points max)

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Zero grammar/spelling errors
- ✅ Clear, logical flow (story → rule #1 → rule #2 → reasoning → personal reflection)
- ✅ Complete thought (no hanging threads)
- ✅ Appropriate length for Personal Update (312 words = target range 200-400)
- ✅ Formatting correct (headers, bullet lists)
- ✅ Reading level appropriate (8th grade - no jargon like LTV/CAC/TAM)

**Technical Score: 3/3** (Flawless execution)

---

### Impact (3 points max)

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Shows LeadGrow's selectivity (positioning through criteria)
- ✅ Memorable (2 simple questions, easy to remember)
- ✅ Proof-driven (real call examples, specific numbers: $5K, 20K, 400 targets, 8 weeks)
- ✅ Relatable (founders can apply the thinking to their own qualification)

**Specific value delivered:**
1. Behind-the-scenes look at Mitchell's qualification process
2. Clear criteria (not prescriptive advice, but LeadGrow's standards)
3. Math showing why criteria matter (40+ replies needed for $500/mo product)
4. Personal experience (turned down good deals that failed criteria)
5. Proof of selectivity working (only lost 4 clients, fired 2)

**Impact Score: 3/3** (High value - positions through selectivity)

## Step 5: Publish to Typefully (DRAFT Mode)

**Action:** Create Typefully draft

**Post Content for Typefully:**

```
I turn down deals all the time.

A founder called me last week. Solid product. Big market. Good revenue. Wanted help with outbound.

I said no.

Why? His customers pay $500/month. Even if we hit 12% reply rates (that's exceptional), the math doesn't work. He'd need 40+ positive replies just to close enough deals to cover the first month of working with us.

We only work with companies where customers pay at least $5K. Below that, cold email costs more than it's worth.

That's rule #1.

Rule #2: market needs to be at least 20,000 companies.

Had another call with someone selling to a super specific niche. Maybe 3,000 total companies worldwide that could buy. Great product. Perfect fit for those companies.

Still said no.

Here's why: you burn through targets fast. After you filter for decision-makers, company size, geography, timing - you're down to maybe 400 qualified people to contact. You'll hit all of them in 8 weeks.

Then what?

20,000 companies gives you room to test, break things, fix them, and keep going.

## Why I'm sharing this

Not to flex about saying no. It's cause I used to say yes to everything.

Took deals that looked good but the numbers didn't work. Spent months trying to force campaigns to work when the problem was the deal itself.

Now I qualify hard upfront.

Two questions:
- Do your customers pay you $5K+?
- Are there 20K+ companies that could buy?

If no to either, I pass. Even if everything else looks perfect.

Saved me a ton of headaches this year. Only lost 4 clients in 2025 and I fired 2 of them at month 2.

The deals that clear these two bars? Those actually work.

## Additional Notes

**Why 10/10:**
This post exemplifies everything Mitchell's Personal Update content should be:
- Personal story format (not prescriptive advice)
- Shows LeadGrow's selectivity without being preachy
- Simple language (8th grade, no jargon)
- Proof through specificity (real calls, exact numbers)
- Speaks TO founders evaluating cold email (not about agencies)
- Vulnerable admission ("I used to say yes to everything")
- Confident closer based on experience ("The deals that clear these two bars? Those actually work.")

**Content Type Correction Applied:**
Original brief was interpreted as universal advice Tactical Guide. Corrected to Personal Update showing Mitchell's qualification process. This positions LeadGrow's selectivity without telling readers what they "should" do.

**Audience Correction Applied:**
Speaks directly to founders/revenue leaders evaluating cold email, not to agency owners or competitors.

**Reading Level Correction Applied:**
8th grade achieved - replaced jargon (LTV/CAC/TAM) with plain English ("what customers pay", "the math doesn't work").

**Engagement Prediction:** High saves/bookmarks (clear qualification framework), moderate replies (may spark discussions about fit), strong positioning (shows selectivity = authority)
