## The Honest Conversation Nobody Wants to Have

I told a prospect yesterday that cold email probably isn't their best move.

$75K ticket size. Enterprise targets. Multi-stakeholder buying process. No marketing team. No CRM.

"You should focus on content," I said. "Long term, you'll get more out of it."

Most agencies would've just taken the deal. We didn't.

Here's why—and how to figure out if you're in the same boat.

## The Cold Email Trap

Cold email works. We've booked 2,000+ meetings in 2024 using it.

But it doesn't work for everyone.

The problem: most companies treat outbound like a universal solution. They assume if they just find the right agency, write better copy, test more subject lines—it'll work.

Sometimes the issue isn't execution. It's fit.

Here's the framework I use to decide: content or outbound?

## When Content Wins (And You Should Know Before Spending)

### You're Targeting Fortune 500 Companies

Large enterprises have strong inbox defenses. Google and Outlook protect them aggressively.

If you send at scale to Fortune 500 targets, you'll ruin your sender reputation in 30 days. Then you're buying new infrastructure every month at $5K+ just to keep sending.

The math doesn't work.

What works better: SEO-driven content that captures existing demand. These companies are already searching for solutions. You need to show up when they search.

Outbound can still play a role—but as a precision tool, not a volume play. Target 50 companies with hyper-personalized outreach. Not 5,000.

### You Have Multi-Stakeholder Buying

If closing deals requires alignment across marketing, data, analytics, media, and loyalty teams—cold email gets complicated fast.

You can't just book one meeting and close. You need champions across departments.

Content solves this differently. A well-positioned piece of thought leadership gets forwarded internally. One stakeholder shares it with three others. Now you're in multiple inboxes without sending to multiple people.

Outbound works when you're selling to one decision-maker with budget authority. It breaks down when you need consensus across silos.

### Your Ticket Size is $75K+

High-ticket deals have long sales cycles. 3-6 months minimum.

Cold email is great for speed. Book a meeting in week 2. Close by month 3.

But $75K+ deals? They don't move that fast. Prospects need to see you multiple times. They're Googling you. Checking your LinkedIn. Reading your content.

If they find nothing—or worse, generic agency fluff—you lose credibility.

Content builds the foundation. Outbound becomes the accelerant.

### You Have No Marketing Foundation

No CRM. No website traffic. No LinkedIn presence. No case studies.

Starting with outbound in this situation is like building the roof before the foundation.

You'll book meetings. Then what?

Prospects Google you. Nothing. They check LinkedIn. Ghost town. They ask for references. You scramble.

Fix the foundation first. Build content that positions authority. Get the CRM. Create the systems. Then add outbound.

## When Outbound Wins (And You Can Move Fast)

### You're Targeting Mid-Market (Not Enterprise)

Companies with 50-500 employees have simpler buying processes. Usually 1-2 decision-makers with budget authority.

Cold email thrives here. You're not fighting enterprise inbox defenses. You're reaching people who actually check email and make decisions.

We typically see 8-12% reply rates in this range with good targeting.

### Your ICP is Clear and Narrow

If you can describe your ideal customer in one sentence—and they meet our criteria ($5K+ customer value, 20K+ addressable market)—outbound works.

Example: "We sell to B2B SaaS companies, 50-200 employees, raised Series A in the last 18 months, selling to mid-market."

That's narrow enough to build targeted campaigns. Broad enough to sustain volume.

If your ICP is "anyone who needs marketing help"—fix that first.

### You Need Speed

Content takes time. Write, publish, rank, distribute, nurture. 6-12 months to see real traction.

Outbound is fast. Week 1: launch. Week 2: first meetings. Week 4: know what works. Week 8: scale.

If you need pipeline in 90 days, outbound beats content.

### You Can Test and Iterate Quickly

Outbound requires speed. Reply to engaged leads in under 5 minutes. Test new messaging weekly. Kill underperformers fast. Double down on winners.

If your company needs three stakeholders to approve a subject line change—outbound won't work. You're too slow.

Content is more forgiving. Publish monthly. Refine over time. Doesn't require daily iteration.

## The Hybrid Play (Best of Both)

Here's what I told that prospect yesterday:

"Content is your long-term play. Outbound is your messaging lab."

Use outbound to figure out what resonates. Fast.

Test 3-4 positioning angles. See which gets the most replies. See which language prospects use in responses. See which pain points they mention.

Then feed that into your content strategy.

Now your blog posts aren't guessing. Your SEO targets the exact language your market uses. Your LinkedIn content addresses the objections you heard 50 times in email replies.

Outbound becomes the research arm. Content becomes the scale arm.

## How to Decide (The 5-Question Framework)

Ask yourself:

**1. Who are you targeting?**
- Mid-market (50-500 employees) → Outbound leans favorable
- Enterprise (Fortune 500) → Content leans favorable

**2. How complex is your sale?**
- 1-2 decision-makers → Outbound works
- Multi-stakeholder consensus → Content works better

**3. What's your ticket size?**
- Under $25K → Outbound can close fast
- $75K+ → Content builds credibility over time

**4. How fast do you need results?**
- 90 days → Outbound
- 6-12 months → Content

**5. Can you iterate quickly?**
- Yes, we're nimble → Outbound thrives
- No, we need approvals → Content fits better

If you answered mostly left column: start with outbound.

If you answered mostly right column: start with content.

If you're split: do both, but use outbound as your messaging testing ground.

## What We Actually Recommended

That prospect from yesterday? Here's what we proposed:

3-month proof of concept. Not to "get X meetings." To figure out if outbound can work as a channel.

We'll test messaging fast. See what resonates. Document the language their market uses.

Then they take those insights and feed them into:
- Content strategy (blog topics, SEO keywords)
- Paid ads (LinkedIn targeting, ad copy)
- Inbound qualification (what questions to ask leads)

Outbound might not become their primary channel. But it'll make every other channel better.

That's the honest play.

## The Bottom Line

Not every company should start with cold email.

Some should build content first. Some should do both. Some should use outbound as a research tool, not a lead gen machine.

The agencies that won't tell you this? They're selling, not advising.

We're selective. We pass on deals that don't fit. We fired two clients at month 2 this year because the fit wasn't there.

If you're evaluating cold email right now, run through the 5 questions above.

Be honest about your answers.

If outbound isn't the play, don't force it. Build the foundation first.

If it is the play—let's figure out if we can help.
