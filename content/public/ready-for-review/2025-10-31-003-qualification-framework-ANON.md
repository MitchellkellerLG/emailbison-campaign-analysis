I turn down deals all the time.

A founder called me last week. Solid product. Big market. Good revenue. Wanted help with outbound.

I said no.

Why? His customers pay $500/month. Even if we hit 12% reply rates (that's exceptional), the math doesn't work. He'd need 40+ positive replies just to close enough deals to cover the first month of working with us.

We only work with companies where customers pay at least $5K. Below that, cold email costs more than it's worth.

That's rule #1.

Rule #2: market needs to be at least 20,000 companies.

Had another call with someone selling to a super specific niche. Maybe 3,000 total companies worldwide that could buy. Great product. Perfect fit for those companies.

Still said no.

Here's why: you burn through targets fast. After you filter for decision-makers, company size, geography, timing - you're down to maybe 400 qualified people to contact. You'll hit all of them in 8 weeks.

Then what?

20,000 companies gives you room to test, break things, fix them, and keep going.

## Why I'm sharing this

Not to flex about saying no. It's cause I used to say yes to everything.

Took deals that looked good but the numbers didn't work. Spent months trying to force campaigns to work when the problem was the deal itself.

Now I qualify hard upfront.

Two questions:
- Do your customers pay you $5K+?
- Are there 20K+ companies that could buy?

If no to either, I almost always pass. Unless it's a highly vertical offer where we can do some wild stuff with targeting - like gaming companies or specific manufacturers where the small market actually helps.

Saved me a ton of headaches this year. Only lost 4 clients in 2025 and I fired 2 of them at month 2.

The deals that clear these two bars? Those actually work.
