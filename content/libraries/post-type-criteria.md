### 1. Tactical Guide
**Funnel Stage:** Top of Funnel (Awareness/Personality)

**Purpose:** Teach a specific, actionable tactic that solves a real problem.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Specific tactic:** Not generic advice—exact steps, methods, or frameworks
- **Actionable:** Reader can implement immediately without needing more context
- **Proof-driven:** Backed by metrics or real examples (not just theory)
- **Mitchell's voice:** Sounds like he's teaching on a call, not writing marketing copy
- **80/20 balance:** 80% tactical teaching, 20% subtle positioning

**Structure:**
1. Hook (common mistake or problem)
2. Why it matters (consequences of getting it wrong)
3. Specific tactic (step-by-step or numbered list)
4. Proof point (metric or example showing it works)
5. How to implement (make it actionable)

**Good Example:**
"Most B2B teams target champions—mid-level folks who love the product. Here's the problem: champions don't have budget authority. We ran a campaign for a K-12 client that hit 12.4% reply rate by targeting district administrators with budget authority. Here's how to identify decision-makers: [4 specific methods with examples]."

**Bad Example:**
"Targeting the right people is important for cold email success. Make sure you research your ICP carefully and send personalized messages. This will improve your results."
**Why it's bad:** Generic, no specific tactic, no proof, no actionable steps

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if sounds exactly like Mitchell teaching. 3/4 if mostly his voice. 2/4 if generic agency voice. 1/4 if corporate speak.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if error-free and clear. 2/3 if minor issues. 1/3 if confusing or incomplete.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if highly actionable and memorable. 2/3 if useful but not exceptional. 1/3 if generic advice.

### 2. Client Success Story
**Funnel Stage:** Middle of Funnel (Expertise)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate LeadGrow's expertise through real results achieved for a client.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Real results:** Exact metrics from LeadGrow's actual work (not client's independent success)
- **Challenge context:** What problem the client faced
- **LeadGrow's approach:** What Mitchell/team did specifically
- **Results with metrics:** Quantifiable improvement with exact numbers
- **Universal lesson:** Takeaway applicable to readers' situations

**Structure:**
1. Hook (compelling result)
2. Challenge context (what the client faced)
3. LeadGrow's approach (what we did specifically)
4. Results (exact metrics and outcomes)
5. Key lessons (what this proves, universal principles)

**Good Example:**
"We just wrapped a campaign for a higher ed client that hit 9.8% reply rate (vs 6-8% typical). The challenge: college counselors are skeptical and get hammered with EdTech pitches. Our approach: tested subject lines around different value props—problem-focused (6.2%), peer-comparison (7.1%), tactical-methodology (9.8%). The winner wasn't better written—it was better positioned. Lesson: test positioning, not just phrasing."

**Bad Example:**
"We helped a client get great results with cold email. They were struggling to get replies, so we optimized their campaigns and saw significant improvement. They were very happy with the outcome."
**Why it's bad:** No specific metrics, no details about approach, no actionable lesson, vague language

**CRITICAL RULE:** Only create success stories about LeadGrow's work. If the result came from the client's own marketing/channels, it's NOT our story to tell.

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if specific, confident, proof-driven. 3/4 if mostly there. 2/4 if generic. 1/4 if sounds like a testimonial ad.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if well-structured with clear flow. 2/3 if minor clarity issues. 1/3 if confusing or incomplete.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if teaches valuable lesson with proof. 2/3 if interesting but less actionable. 1/3 if just bragging.

### 3. Objection Handling
**Funnel Stage:** Middle/Bottom of Funnel

**Purpose:** Address common objections or concerns prospects have, showing Mitchell's expertise in handling pushback.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Real objection:** Something prospects actually say (not made-up concerns)
- **Mitchell's response:** His actual approach to handling it
- **Why it works:** Logic or proof behind the response (success rate if available)
- **Universal principle:** Applicable beyond the specific objection
- **Positioning value:** Shows Mitchell thinks strategically, not just executes

**Structure:**
1. Hook (state the objection)
2. Why it happens (context/background)
3. Mitchell's response (exact approach or phrasing)
4. Why it works (metrics, logic, or proof)
5. Universal principle (reframe for broader application)

**Good Example:**
"'We already have a student success platform.' Our EdTech clients hear this constantly. Most sellers try to position as better or cheaper—bad move. We say: 'Most schools use 3-4 tools. We integrate with all of them and focus specifically on early intervention.' This works 70% of the time because: [4 reasons]. The key: don't fight the objection, reposition as complementary."

**Bad Example:**
"When prospects say they already have a solution, just explain how your product is different and better than what they're using. Persistence pays off."
**Why it's bad:** Generic advice, no specific response, no proof it works, no Mitchell voice

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if confident, tactical, and proof-driven. 3/4 if mostly authentic. 2/4 if too salesy. 1/4 if generic.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if clear and complete. 2/3 if slightly unclear. 1/3 if confusing.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if teaches replicable approach with proof. 2/3 if useful but less actionable. 1/3 if just theory.

### 4. Personal Update
**Funnel Stage:** Top of Funnel (Personality/Humanizing)

**Purpose:** Share behind-the-scenes moments, team updates, or personal reflections that humanize Mitchell and LeadGrow.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Authentic moment:** Real situation, not manufactured for content
- **Relatable context:** Readers can connect with the experience
- **Lesson or insight:** Not just storytelling—there's a takeaway
- **Mitchell's voice:** Conversational, honest, reflective
- **Personality-driven:** Shows who Mitchell is, not just what he does

**Structure:**
1. Hook (the moment or situation)
2. Context (what was happening)
3. Why it matters (significance or challenge)
4. Lesson/reflection (what Mitchell learned or realized)
5. Takeaway (how readers can apply or relate)

**Good Example:**
"Fired a client this morning. Two months in, they still haven't implemented a single recommendation we made. They blame us for 'low quality leads'—but they won't follow up within 48 hours like we advised. Here's what I learned about firing clients early: [insights about client fit, red flags, when to cut losses]. Best breakups happen fast."

**Bad Example:**
"Had a great day at the office today! The team is working hard and we're excited about some new projects. Grateful for the opportunity to do what we love."
**Why it's bad:** Generic, no specific moment, no lesson, no personality, sounds like LinkedIn fluff

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if authentic Mitchell personality. 3/4 if mostly genuine. 2/4 if forced. 1/4 if corporate platitudes.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if clear narrative. 2/3 if slightly unclear. 1/3 if confusing.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if memorable lesson. 2/3 if relatable but light. 1/3 if just storytelling with no takeaway.

### 5. Question/Answer
**Funnel Stage:** Top/Middle of Funnel

**Purpose:** Answer a real question from a prospect, client, or audience, demonstrating Mitchell's expertise.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Real question:** Something someone actually asked (not made-up)
- **Clear answer:** Mitchell's specific response with reasoning
- **Supporting proof:** Metrics, examples, or logic backing the answer
- **Actionable:** Reader can implement the advice
- **Educational tone:** Teaching, not just answering

**Structure:**
1. Hook (state the question)
2. Why it's important (context for why this matters)
3. Mitchell's answer (specific response)
4. Supporting proof (metrics, examples, or reasoning)
5. Actionable next step (how to apply)

**Good Example:**
"A prospect asked: 'How do you know if our ICP is too narrow?' Great question—most teams err on the side of too broad. The criteria for us: LTV $5K+ per client, and market of 20K+ companies. If you meet those two criteria, there's something there. Below that, you're either targeting a niche without enough volume or clients without enough value to justify the CAC. Here's how to evaluate your ICP: [framework]."

**Bad Example:**
"Q: How do I improve cold email results? A: Focus on personalization, test different approaches, and make sure you're targeting the right audience. Hope that helps!"
**Why it's bad:** Generic answer, no specific framework, no proof, no Mitchell voice

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if specific and proof-driven. 3/4 if mostly there. 2/4 if generic advice. 1/4 if corporate.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if clear and complete. 2/3 if minor issues. 1/3 if unclear.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if highly actionable with proof. 2/3 if useful but generic. 1/3 if just an opinion.

### 6. Strategy Guide
**Funnel Stage:** Middle of Funnel (Authority)

**Purpose:** Teach a comprehensive framework, methodology, or strategic approach in depth.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Complete framework:** 3-5 steps/principles with detailed explanation
- **Multiple examples:** Real situations showing each step in action
- **Proof throughout:** Metrics and outcomes supporting the framework
- **Actionable implementation:** Reader can use this immediately
- **Authority positioning:** Demonstrates deep expertise, not surface-level advice

**Structure:**
1. Problem statement (what challenge this solves)
2. Framework overview (introduce the approach)
3. Step 1 with example and proof
4. Step 2 with example and proof
5. Step 3 with example and proof
6. Results to expect (realistic outcomes)
7. How to start (implementation guidance)

**Good Example:**
"Most agencies optimize copy, test subject lines, and refine CTAs—but never fix the targeting. Here's our 3-step targeting framework: [Step 1: Identify decision-makers vs influencers + 4 methods + example]. [Step 2: Validate market size + LTV threshold + example]. [Step 3: Test positioning angles + subject line framework + higher ed case study]. When we applied this to a K-12 client, reply rate went from 1.2% to 12.4%. Here's how to implement: [actionable steps]."

**Bad Example:**
"Good targeting is important. You should research your ICP, understand their pain points, and craft messaging that resonates. Use data to inform your decisions and iterate based on results."
**Why it's bad:** No specific framework, no steps, no examples, no proof, generic advice

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if Mitchell's strategic voice throughout. 3/4 if mostly authentic. 2/4 if generic. 1/4 if corporate.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if well-organized and clear. 2/3 if minor structure issues. 1/3 if confusing.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if complete, actionable framework with proof. 2/3 if useful but incomplete. 1/3 if just theory.

### 7. Case Study
**Funnel Stage:** Middle/Bottom of Funnel (Proof)

**Purpose:** Detailed breakdown of a client engagement showing LeadGrow's methodology and results in depth.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Complete client journey:** Initial challenge → approach → implementation → results
- **Detailed methodology:** What LeadGrow did specifically (tactics, strategy, decisions)
- **Multiple metrics:** Reply rates, meetings booked, conversion rates, etc.
- **Key lessons:** What worked, what didn't, universal principles
- **Applicability:** How readers can apply lessons to their situation

**Structure:**
1. Client challenge (specific problem they faced)
2. Initial situation (context, previous attempts, constraints)
3. Our approach (strategy and reasoning)
4. Implementation details (tactics, timeline, iterations)
5. Results (comprehensive metrics and outcomes)
6. Key lessons (what this proves, what we learned)
7. Applicability (who this works for, how to replicate)

**Good Example:**
"A higher ed client came to us after their previous agency generated 1.2% reply rate sending 5,000 emails to 'anyone in higher ed.' Challenge: college counselors are skeptical and busy. Our approach: narrow ICP from all colleges to community colleges specifically (where retention problems are more acute), test 3 subject line positioning angles, and implement 48-hour follow-up protocol. Month 1: 6.2% reply rate. Month 2: 7.1% after refining targeting. Month 3: 9.8% after finding winning subject line approach. Key lessons: [5 detailed insights]. This works for B2B services with clear ICP and LTV $5K+."

**Bad Example:**
"We worked with a client in the education space who wanted to improve their outbound. We helped them optimize their campaigns and they saw great results. They're now one of our best success stories."
**Why it's bad:** No specific challenge, no details about approach, no metrics, no lessons, no Mitchell voice

**Voice Score:** 4/4 if detailed and proof-driven. 3/4 if mostly authentic. 2/4 if too promotional. 1/4 if testimonial-like.

**Technical Score:** 3/3 if well-structured with clear flow. 2/3 if minor issues. 1/3 if confusing.

**Impact Score:** 3/3 if highly detailed with actionable lessons. 2/3 if interesting but less applicable. 1/3 if just bragging.

### 8. Product Launch / Giveaway
**Funnel Stage:** Bottom of Funnel (Conversion)

**Purpose:** Promote a new service, offering, or lead magnet with direct call-to-action.

**Success Criteria:**
- **Mitchell approval required:** ⚠️ NEVER draft without explicit approval
- **Strategic timing:** Aligned with business goals and capacity
- **Clear value prop:** What the offer is and why it matters
- **Specific CTA:** Exactly what readers should do next
- **Authority positioning:** Promoted as expert offering, not desperate pitch

**Structure:**
1. Hook (announcement or problem this solves)
2. Context (why now, why this matters)
3. What it is (detailed description)
4. Who it's for (clear ICP)
5. How to get it (specific CTA)
6. Social proof (if available)

**Good Example:**
"We're opening 3 pilot spots for a new service: Cold Email Audit + 30-day implementation. You send us your current campaigns, we analyze targeting/copy/sequence, then implement fixes for 30 days. Cost: $5K. Perfect for B2B companies with LTV $10K+ who are stuck at <5% reply rates. DM me 'AUDIT' if interested—first 3 committed get priority."

**Bad Example:**
"Excited to announce our new service! We're helping companies scale their outbound. Limited spots available. DM for details!"
**Why it's bad:** Vague, no specific offer, no ICP, no pricing, generic pitch

**⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIREMENT:**
Product launches require Mitchell approval BEFORE drafting because:
- Strategic timing matters (capacity, positioning, market conditions)
- Pricing and packaging need his input
- CTA and fulfillment must be realistic
- Mitchell controls all conversion-focused content

**DO NOT CREATE** product launch briefs or drafts without explicit Mitchell direction.

## Publishing Decision

**Total Score = Voice + Technical + Impact (max 10 points)**

**8-10 points:** PUBLISH - Push to Typefully as draft
**6-7 points:** REVISE - Flag for writer improvements with specific guidance
**0-5 points:** REJECT - Document why, do not publish

**Example Scoring:**
- **Tactical Guide:** Voice 4/4 + Technical 3/3 + Impact 2/3 = **9/10 → PUBLISH**
- **Client Story:** Voice 3/4 + Technical 3/3 + Impact 1/3 = **7/10 → REVISE** (needs more impact)
- **Generic Post:** Voice 2/4 + Technical 2/3 + Impact 1/3 = **5/10 → REJECT** (wrong voice, low value)

---

## Edge Cases & Special Rules

### When Post Type is Unclear
- If it teaches specific tactics → Tactical Guide
- If it shares client results → Client Success Story
- If it addresses objections → Objection Handling
- If it's personal/reflective → Personal Update
- If it answers a question → Question/Answer
- When in doubt, default to Tactical Guide

### When Quality is Borderline (7.5 feels like 8)
- Round down. 7.5 = REVISE.
- Only clear 8+ posts publish
- Quality bar is non-negotiable

### When Content Has Client Leak But Perfect Quality
- Automatic 0/10 rejection
- Anonymization failure overrides all other scoring
- Fix leak, re-review from scratch

### When Mitchell Requests Override
- If Mitchell says "publish this 7," note his override in review
- Still document why it scored 7
- Mitchell's judgment supersedes rubric when he's explicit
