# Brand Voice Library: Mitchell Keller

**Purpose:** This library defines Mitchell's authentic writing voice so all content sounds like he wrote it personally—specific, confident, tactical, and proof-driven.

**Critical Audience Note:** We write TO revenue leaders, sales leaders, BD leaders, and founders who need to grow. NOT to agency owners or competitors. Speak directly to the person evaluating whether cold email will work for their company.

**Reading Level:** 8th grade. Short sentences. Simple words. Clear cause and effect. Avoid jargon unless Mitchell actually uses it in conversation.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Specific Over Generic
Mitchell doesn't say vague things. Every claim has exact metrics, real situations, or concrete examples.

**❌ Generic:**
"We help clients get great results with cold email."

**✅ Mitchell:**
"We ran a campaign last quarter that generated 12.4% reply rate by targeting district administrators with budget authority, not just influence."

### 2. Confident But Not Arrogant
Mitchell positions expertise through proof, not superlatives. He says what he knows works, backed by data.

**❌ Arrogant:**
"We're the best cold email agency in the world."

**❌ Too Humble:**
"We try our best to help clients succeed."

**✅ Mitchell:**
"We typically see 8-12% reply rates in EdTech outreach when targeting decision-makers correctly."

### 3. Tactical and Educational (80/20 Rule)
80% of content teaches something actionable. 20% positions LeadGrow's expertise subtly.

**Structure:**
- Lead with valuable insight
- Share specific tactics
- Prove with metrics/examples
- Position expertise naturally in context

**❌ Too salesy:**
"Hire us and we'll get you amazing results."

**✅ Mitchell:**
"Most teams target influencers instead of decision-makers. Here's how to identify budget authority: [tactical advice]. We used this approach for a K-12 client last quarter—12.4% reply rate vs their previous 3.2%."

### 4. Proof-Driven (Never Aspirational)
Mitchell doesn't promise or theorize. He shares what actually happened with exact numbers.

**❌ Aspirational:**
"Our strategies can help you scale outbound."

**✅ Mitchell:**
"When a higher ed client narrowed their ICP from all college counselors to community colleges specifically, their reply rate went from 6.2% to 9.8%."

### 5. Conversational (Not Corporate)
Mitchell writes like he talks. Short sentences. 8th grade reading level. No jargon. Speak TO founders/revenue leaders, not about agencies.

**❌ Corporate speak:**
"We leverage strategic positioning to optimize client acquisition velocity."

**❌ Too much jargon (even if accurate):**
"If your LTV is below $5K, the CAC doesn't justify outbound investment."

**✅ Mitchell (simple, direct, to the buyer):**
"If your customers pay you less than $5K, you need a different way to get them. Ads, SEO, referrals. Not cold email."

**✅ Mitchell (audience: founders evaluating cold email):**
"Before you spend money on cold email, answer 2 questions: Do your customers pay you at least $5K? Are there at least 20,000 companies that could buy from you?"

## Tone Characteristics

### Confident, Not Pushy
Mitchell knows what works because he's seen it work repeatedly. He's not selling—he's sharing expertise.

**Example:**
"Subject line testing is the most underrated lever in cold email. Most teams pick one subject line and blast it. We test 3-4 positioning angles—problem-focused vs peer-comparison vs tactical-methodology. A higher ed client went from 6.2% to 9.8% reply rate by finding the right positioning."

### Direct, Not Abrasive
Mitchell tells it straight but doesn't trash competitors or mock people doing it wrong.

**❌ Too abrasive:**
"Most agencies are idiots who don't know what they're doing."

**✅ Mitchell:**
"Most agencies optimize copy but never fix the targeting. They're running A/B tests on the wrong audience."

### Tactical, Not Theoretical
Mitchell teaches specific actions, not abstract concepts.

**❌ Theoretical:**
"It's important to align your messaging with your ICP's pain points."

**✅ Mitchell:**
"Ask your target: 'Are you typically involved in vendor evaluation and selection for tools like ours?' Good decision-makers will clarify their role. Influencers will either admit it or try to connect you with the right person."

## Content Structure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hook with Common Mistake
1. Start with what most people do wrong
2. Explain why it doesn't work
3. Share the better approach
4. Prove it with metrics/example
5. Teach how to implement

**Example:**
"Most B2B teams target champions—mid-level folks who love the product. Makes sense, right? Here's the problem: champions don't have budget authority. You'll get great conversations but no deals. We ran a campaign for a K-12 client that hit 12.4% by targeting district administrators who control purchasing, not school coordinators who just advocate. Here's how to identify decision-makers vs influencers: [tactical list]."

### Pattern 2: Result → Breakdown → Lesson
1. Lead with compelling result
2. Explain the challenge/context
3. Break down what was done
4. Share the outcome with metrics
5. Extract the universal lesson

**Example:**
"We just wrapped a campaign that hit 9.8% reply rate in higher ed. Industry average is 4-6%, good performance is 6-8%, so this was exceptional. The client sells to college counselors—skeptical, busy people who get hammered with EdTech pitches. The key was subject line testing across different value props, not just different wordings. [Breakdown of 3 tested approaches with results]. Here's what we learned: [lessons list]."

### Pattern 3: Question/Answer with Authority
1. Pose a real objection or question
2. Explain why it's common
3. Share Mitchell's answer/approach
4. Prove why it works (metrics or logic)
5. Make it actionable

**Example:**
"'We already have a [solution like yours].' Every B2B seller hears this objection constantly. Most handle it badly—they try to position as better or cheaper. Here's what works: position as complementary. When an EdTech client gets this objection, we say: 'Most schools use 3-4 tools. We integrate with all of them and focus specifically on early intervention.' This works 70% of the time because [reasons]. The key: find the dimension where you're complementary, not competitive."

## What Mitchell NEVER Says

### Never Use Marketing Jargon (Even Industry-Standard Terms)
Avoid acronyms and insider language. Founders don't talk like marketers.

**Replace jargon with plain English:**
- ❌ "LTV" / "CAC" / "TAM" / "ICP"
- ✅ "what customers pay you" / "cost to get customers" / "how many companies could buy" / "who you sell to"

- ❌ "Unit economics don't work"
- ✅ "The math doesn't work"

- ❌ "Your TAM is insufficient for sustained outbound motion"
- ✅ "You'll run out of people to contact too fast"

- ❌ "Decision-maker vs influencer delineation"
- ✅ "People who can buy vs people who can't"

**Exception:** Use jargon only when Mitchell actually says it in conversation (like in transcripts). If he said "LTV" to a client, you can use it. But default to simple English.

### Never Use Superlatives
- ❌ "best"
- ❌ "world-class"
- ❌ "revolutionary"
- ❌ "game-changing"
- ❌ "cutting-edge"

**Instead:** Use proof and comparisons
- ✅ "9.8% vs industry average of 4-6%"
- ✅ "This approach outperformed their previous agency by 3x"

### Never Over-Promise
- ❌ "We'll 10x your pipeline"
- ❌ "Guaranteed results"
- ❌ "We can help any company scale"

**Instead:** Be honest about scope
- ✅ "This works for B2B companies with LTV $5K+ and markets of 20K+ companies"
- ✅ "We typically see 8-12 qualified meetings per month in EdTech"

### Never Use Empty Buzzwords
- ❌ "leverage synergies"
- ❌ "optimize conversion velocity"
- ❌ "strategic alignment"
- ❌ "thought leadership"

**Instead:** Say what you mean plainly
- ✅ "Test 3-4 positioning angles"
- ✅ "Target decision-makers, not influencers"
- ✅ "Write sequences that sound human"

## Length and Structure

### Shortform Posts (280-500 words)
- One core idea
- 3-5 supporting points
- 1-2 proof points (metrics/examples)
- Clear takeaway

### Longform Posts (800-1500 words)
- One strategic framework
- 3-5 steps/principles
- Multiple examples
- Detailed proof
- Actionable next steps

### Sentence Length
- Vary length for rhythm
- Short sentences for impact: "Here's the thing."
- Longer sentences for explanation: "When a higher ed client narrowed their ICP from all college counselors to community colleges specifically, their reply rate went from 6.2% to 9.8% because the product solves retention problems that are way more acute in that segment."

## Real Examples: Mitchell's Actual Voice

### Example 1: Personal + Lesson (High engagement: 9 likes, 0.044 ER)
"Just said no to a deal cause I was getting bad vibes.

This is the position I once dreamt of being in.

Only way to get there is a pipeline that is thiccccc + low af churn."

**Why this works:**
- Blunt, honest opening
- Personal reflection ("position I once dreamt of")
- Specific advice (pipeline + churn)
- Informal language ("thiccccc," "af")
- Shows positioning through results, not claims

### Example 2: Tactical + Proof (High engagement: 148 likes, 0.038 ER)
"Here's how to do it. (without getting complicated with strategy).

Infrastructure

Go to porkbun or Spaceship, buy stupendous amount of .co, .com .info sub domains

Go to scaled mail and zap mail and give them your domains - they will spin up 1000's of inboxes.

Warm for 3-6 [weeks]"

**Why this works:**
- Direct tactical steps
- Specific tool names (Porkbun, Spaceship, Scaled Mail)
- Numbers ("1000's of inboxes," "3-6 weeks")
- No fluff ("without getting complicated")
- Actionable from start to finish

### Example 3: Contrarian Take (High engagement: 40 likes, 0.020 ER)
"people be turning the dumbest shit into a lead magnet these days

Comment 'shit' and I'll send you his payment processor."

**Why this works:**
- Calls out common behavior
- Informal, conversational ("dumbest shit")
- Playful/sarcastic tone
- Direct CTA with humor
- Not trying to sound professional

### Example 4: Client Success Story (High engagement: 25 likes, 0.037 ER)
"One week into a trial where I'm competing with another agency for the full gig.

Other agency sent the client itself a cold email about the clients offer.

Bar is low gents."

**Why this works:**
- Real situation, not fabricated
- Shows competitor mistake (implicit expertise)
- Deadpan humor ("Bar is low gents")
- Confidence without bragging
- Builds authority through observation

### Example 5: Philosophical + Tactical (High engagement: 14 likes, 0.037 ER)
"Communication is the solution to client churn.

Underperforming client, but thoughtful well intentioned next steps have turned into massive winners time and time again at leadgrow.

On the flip side, our only churn this year has been us pulling the plug before the contract is [up]"

**Why this works:**
- Clear principle stated upfront
- Proof from both sides (winners + intentional churn)
- Lowercase "leadgrow" (casual, authentic)
- Specific timeframe ("this year")
- Shows they fire bad fits (selectivity = authority)

## Common Voice Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Too Generic
**Bad:** "Cold email works when done right."
**Mitchell:** "Cold email works when you target decision-makers with budget authority and test positioning angles—we typically see 8-12% reply rates with this approach."

### Mistake 2: Too Formal
**Bad:** "Our methodology facilitates superior outcomes through strategic targeting optimization."
**Mitchell:** "We target decision-makers, not influencers. That's why our reply rates are 3-4x industry average."

### Mistake 3: Too Salesy
**Bad:** "Hire us to 10x your pipeline with our world-class cold email services."
**Mitchell:** "We helped a K-12 client go from 1.2% to 12.4% reply rate by fixing their targeting. If you're in a similar situation, let's talk."

### Mistake 4: No Proof
**Bad:** "Subject line testing is important for cold email success."
**Mitchell:** "A higher ed client went from 6.2% to 9.8% reply rate by testing subject lines around different value props—problem-focused vs peer-comparison vs tactical-methodology."

### Mistake 5: Over-Promising
**Bad:** "We guarantee you'll get 100 meetings in 90 days."
**Mitchell:** "We typically book 8-12 qualified meetings per month for EdTech clients at your stage. Depends on ICP quality and targeting precision."
