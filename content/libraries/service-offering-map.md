# LeadGrow Service Offering Map

**Purpose:** Comprehensive map of LeadGrow services with 80% tactical detail for content creation. Use this to ensure content accurately represents what LeadGrow does and how they do it.

## Core Philosophy: Situation-Based Outbound

**The Big Idea:** Most outbound targets MARKETS. LeadGrow targets SITUATIONS.

### The 3-Tier Market Structure

```
         ▲ 3% Actively Looking (intent signals)
        ███
       █████
      ███████ 30% In Buying Situations (LeadGrow's focus)
     █████████
    ███████████
   █████████████
  ███████████████ 67% Not Ready
 █████████████████
```

**What competitors do:**
1. **Fight over the 3%:** Chase intent signals (pricing page visits, G2 searches, content downloads). Too crowded.
2. **Blast the 100%:** Send generic messages to entire markets. Too noisy (0.8% reply rate).

**What LeadGrow does:**
- **Target the 30% in buying situations:** People who need you RIGHT NOW but don't know you exist yet.
- Examples: VP hired 60 days ago inheriting broken process, company raised Series B needs to scale fast, CAC spiked 40% last quarter, ripped out competitor's tool.

## Three-Pillar Framework

### Pillar 1: Situations, Not Markets

**Core Principle:** Don't message demographics. Message moments when pain becomes urgent.

#### What's a Buying Situation?
Specific moments when pain becomes urgent:

- **The New Exec:** VP hired 60-90 days ago, inheriting broken process, board expects turnaround in 6 months
- **The Scaling Crisis:** Just raised Series B, needs to hire 10 reps in 90 days, no process in place
- **The Cost Spike:** CAC increased 40% last quarter, board asking questions, needs answers fast
- **The Stack Shift:** Just ripped out competitor's tool, actively searching for replacement

**Why this works:** You're not targeting a market. You're targeting a moment in time—a pressure point where your solution becomes urgent.

#### Situation Mining Process

**What LeadGrow does:**
1. **Analyze client CRM:** Look at best customers—what situations were they in when they bought?
2. **Scrape job postings:** New VP hired = inherited problems, new team = scaling pressure
3. **Monitor tech stack changes:** Ripped out competitor tool = actively shopping
4. **Track funding events:** Series B raise = need to scale, need to hire, need to prove ROI
5. **Forum/community signals:** What are people complaining about? When do they complain?

**Output:** 3-5 buying situations where client's solution is urgent RIGHT NOW.

### Pillar 2: Technicians, Not Maintenance Men

**Core Principle:** Diagnose hidden problems, don't just react to obvious pain.

#### The Plumber Analogy

**Maintenance Man:**
"I do plumbing, electrical, drywall, whatever you need! I can fix that."

- Generic. Everyone says this. Gets deleted.

**Technician:**
"I see the toilet flooding. But look—when you flush, your shower runs scalding hot. You've got a pressure valve issue. The flooding is just a symptom. I can fix both in 20 minutes."

- Diagnostic. Surfaces hidden problem. Builds instant trust.

#### How This Shows Up in Messages

**Maintenance Man Message:**
"Hi [Name], we help sales teams improve their outbound. Would love to chat about your goals."

**Technician Message:**
"Saw you hired 3 AEs in 60 days. Most VPs at your stage struggle because new reps don't know who the real buyer is—so they pitch the wrong person and blame 'bad leads.' That happening?"

**Why technician messages work:**
- Find problems prospect didn't know they had
- Surface specific pain tied to their situation
- Build trust through diagnosis, not claims

---

### Pillar 3: End to End, Not Fragmented

**Core Principle:** Own the entire process until prospect is sitting on your calendar.

#### How Most Agencies Work (Fragmented)

1. Agency sends email
2. Prospect replies 4 hours later
3. Agency forwards reply to client
4. Client responds 6 hours later
5. Prospect is cold again
6. Now you're chasing someone who was interested yesterday

**Result:** Context lost. Speed lost. Deal dies.

#### How LeadGrow Works (End to End)

1. We send email
2. Prospect replies
3. **We respond in <5 minutes**
4. **We qualify while context is hot**
5. **We book the meeting**
6. **We confirm 2x before call**
7. **No-show? We recover them**

**Result:** Speed. Context. They show up.

**Why this matters:**

1. **Speed to Lead:** Reply rates drop 400% if you wait more than 5 minutes. We respond while they're still thinking about the problem.

2. **Context Continuity:** We don't hand you a "warm lead" who now has to re-explain their situation. We've already qualified them on exact pain points your solution addresses. Conversation is HOT when they hit your calendar.

3. **Show-Up Rate:**
   - Industry average no-show: 50-60%
   - LeadGrow average: 32%
   - Why? We own relationship until they're on your calendar. We confirm 2x. We keep them engaged.

4. **Time Compression:**
   - Week 1: Launch
   - Week 2: First meetings booked
   - Week 4: You know what works
   - Week 8: You're scaling

## What's Included (Service Deliverables)

### 1. Situation Mining
Analyze CRM, community forums, sales transcripts, job postings, tech stack signals to identify 3-5 buying situations where your solution is urgent.

**Deliverable:** Situation map with specific triggers, pain points, and urgency drivers for each segment.

---

### 2. Custom Data Scraping
Build scrapers to find prospects your competitors don't know exist—emptier inboxes, 1-of-1 messages.

**What this means:**
- Not buying lists from Apollo/ZoomInfo (everyone uses those)
- Custom scrapers for job changes, tech stack shifts, funding events, forum posts
- Find people in buying situations BEFORE they show intent signals

**Deliverable:** Custom prospect lists refreshed weekly with situation-specific triggers.

---

### 3. Bespoke Message Engineering
Test 5-7 message variants per week, wrapped around your specific offer and the pain each situation creates.

**Not generic templates.** Every message is engineered for:
- The specific situation (new exec vs scaling crisis vs cost spike)
- The specific pain that situation creates
- How YOUR solution wraps around that pain

**Example:**
- Same situation: "New VP hired 60 days ago"
- If you sell training: "Most new VPs inherit teams with habits that worked at their last company but are toxic here..."
- If you sell lead gen: "When teams miss quota 3 quarters straight, they blame the leads. But usually the leads are fine—the targeting is wrong..."
- If you sell analytics: "You can't fix what you can't see. Most new VPs spend their first 90 days guessing what's broken..."

Same situation. Same pain. Three completely different messages.

**Deliverable:** 5-7 message tests per week with performance data (reply rate, positive vs negative replies, meeting book rate).

---

### 4. Full Lead Engagement
We respond in <5 minutes, qualify prospects, book meetings, confirm 2x, and recover no-shows. You get people who actually show up.

**What we handle:**
- Reply monitoring (24/7)
- Qualification (surface exact pain, budget authority, timeline)
- Meeting booking (we get them on your calendar)
- Confirmation sequence (2x before call)
- No-show recovery (re-engage within 24 hours)

**Deliverable:** Qualified meetings on your calendar with full context notes (situation, pain surfaced, objections handled, timeline).

---

### 5. GTM Intelligence
Everything syncs to your CRM. You see which SITUATIONS convert best—intel that works across your paid ads, content, and inbound.

**What you learn:**
- Which situations book meetings fastest
- Which pain points resonate most
- Which message angles convert best
- Exact language prospects use to describe their problems

**How this helps other channels:**
- Paid ads: Target same situations on LinkedIn/Google
- Content: Write about situations that convert best
- Inbound: Qualify leads faster using situation framework
- Sales calls: Know exact pain points before call starts

**Deliverable:** Weekly performance reports with situation breakdowns, message test results, and cross-channel insights.

## Client Qualification (Who This Works For)

### Great Fit
- **B2B service businesses with $5K+ LTV**
- **Verticalized SaaS** (clear ICP, specific pain points)
- **Hard-to-reach markets** (gaming, edtech, manufacturing) where hyper-targeting is advantage
- **Teams that want to move fast and iterate**
- **Companies willing to be an open book** (we see your data, you see ours)

### Not a Fit
- **Transactional B2C**
- **<$2K LTV products** (CAC doesn't justify cold email)
- **8 stakeholders to approve a subject line** (too slow, can't iterate)
- **"Set it and forget it" mindset** (we test constantly)
- **Unwilling to test and iterate** (if you need perfection on day 1, we're not the fit)

### Qualification Thresholds

**LTV Threshold:** Minimum $5K LTV per client. Below that, CAC doesn't justify cold email investment.

**Market Size Threshold:** Minimum 20K addressable companies. Smaller markets run out of targets too quickly.

**IMPORTANT CAVEAT:** These are strong guidelines. Mitchell almost always passes on deals below these thresholds, but makes exceptions for highly vertical offers where the small market is an advantage (gaming companies, specific manufacturers). In these cases, hyper-targeted positioning compensates for limited market size. The thresholds are strong guidelines, not absolute disqualifiers.

**ICP Clarity:** Client must have clear ideal customer profile. "Everyone in B2B" = not a fit.

**Willingness to Implement:** Clients must follow recommendations (48-hour follow-up, reply protocols). Non-implementers get fired fast (usually by month 2-3).

**Budget Authority:** Client must have decision-making authority and budget approved. "I need to check with my boss" = not ready.

## Partnership Philosophy

**Most agencies hide behind NDAs and black boxes. We don't.**

- You see our data. We see yours.
- You see our message tests. We see your sales calls.
- You see what's working. We see what's not.

**We're not a vendor. We're your outbound team.**

- If it's not working, we'll tell you before you tell us.
- If the math doesn't work, we'll walk away.
- If your market can't be reached this way, we'll say so.

**We win when you win. That's it.**

## Positioning Strategy

### LeadGrow is NOT:
- ❌ A "cold email agency that sends tons of emails"
- ❌ A "growth hacking" service
- ❌ A generic lead generation agency
- ❌ A "we'll 10x your pipeline" promise-maker

### LeadGrow IS:
- ✅ Situation-based outbound specialists (target moments, not markets)
- ✅ Bespoke message engineers (wrap your offer around their situation)
- ✅ End-to-end execution partners (own entire process until they're on your calendar)
- ✅ Selective partners (only work with $5K+ LTV, clear ICP, willing to iterate)
- ✅ Transparent educators (share 80% of methods publicly)

### Key Differentiators:
1. **Situations Over Markets:** Target the 30% in buying situations, not the 3% showing intent or the 100% in your TAM
2. **Technician Messages:** Diagnose hidden problems, don't just react to obvious pain
3. **End-to-End Ownership:** Reply in <5 minutes, qualify while context is hot, own relationship until they show up
4. **Bespoke Engineering:** Every message wrapped around specific situation + specific pain + YOUR solution
5. **80% Transparency:** Share frameworks publicly, hold back proprietary execution

---

## Content Creation Guidelines

### When Writing About Services:

**DO:**
- ✅ Share situation targeting framework (how to identify buying situations)
- ✅ Use exact metrics (15-30% reply rate, 2,000+ meetings, 68% show rate)
- ✅ Explain reasoning (why situations beat demographics, why speed matters)
- ✅ Teach frameworks (3-tier market structure, technician vs maintenance, end-to-end ownership)
- ✅ Position through proof ("We booked 2,000+ meetings in 2024")

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Share exact email copy (hold back bespoke sequences)
- ❌ Over-promise results ("We'll 10x your pipeline guaranteed")
- ❌ Generic positioning ("We're the best cold email agency")
- ❌ Reveal proprietary scrapers/data sources
- ❌ Use client names in public content (anonymize them)

---

## How to Use This in Content

### For Tactical Guides:
"Here's how to identify buying situations: [3-tier market structure, situation triggers, pain diagnosis]"

### For Client Success Stories:
"A B2B SaaS client went from 1.2% reply rate (generic market targeting) to 18% (situation-based targeting)—here's the exact situation we targeted and why it worked"

### For Objection Handling:
"'Cold email doesn't work in our industry' → You're right if you're targeting markets. But if you target situations, reply rates go from 1% to 15%+."

### For Personal Updates:
"Fired a client at month 2—they wanted 'set it and forget it' but our model is test-iterate-scale. Best breakups happen fast."

### For Strategy Guides:
"The 3-tier market structure: Stop fighting over the 3% showing intent. Target the 30% in buying situations instead."

## Final Note

**The 80/20 Rule:**
Share 80% tactical detail (frameworks, methods, thinking) to position authority. Hold back 20% proprietary execution (exact copy, scrapers, client sequences). This builds trust and demonstrates expertise without giving away everything.

When in doubt about what to share, ask: "Would this help a reader implement better outbound themselves?" If yes, share it. If it's client-specific execution or proprietary data sources, hold back.
